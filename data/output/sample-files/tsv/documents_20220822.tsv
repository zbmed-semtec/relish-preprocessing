16638632	Analysis of degradation of bacterial cell division protein FtsZ by the ATP-dependent zinc-metalloprotease FtsH in vitro.	The identity of protease(s), which would degrade bacterial cell division protein FtsZ in vivo, remains unknown. However, we had earlier demonstrated that Escherichia coli metalloprotease FtsH degrades E. coli cell division protein FtsZ in an ATP- and Zn(2+)-dependent manner in vitro. In this study, we examined FtsH protease-mediated degradation of FtsZ in vitro in detail using seven different deletion mutants of FtsZ as the substrates, which lack different extents of specific regions at the N- or C-terminus. FtsH protease assay in vitro on these mutants revealed that FtsH could degrade all the seven deletion mutants irrespective of the deletions or the extent of deletions at the N- or C-terminus. These observations indicated that neither the N-terminus nor the C-terminus was required for the degradation of FtsZ, like already known in the case of the FtsH substrate sigma(32) protein. The recombinant clones expressing full-length FtsZ protein and FtsZ deletion mutant proteins would be useful in investigating the possibility of FtsZ as a potential in vivo substrate for FtsH in ftsH-null cells carrying ftsH suppressor function and ectopically expressed FtsH protease.
16735107	Screening of free-living rhizospheric bacteria for their multiple plant growth promoting activities.	Plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are known to influence plant growth by various direct or indirect mechanisms. In search of efficient PGPR strains with multiple activities, a total of 72 bacterial isolates belonging to Azotobacter, fluorescent Pseudomonas, Mesorhizobium and Bacillus were isolated from different rhizospheric soil and plant root nodules in the vicinity of Aligarh. These test isolates were biochemically characterized. These isolates were screened in vitro for their plant growth promoting traits like production of indoleacetic acid (IAA), ammonia (NH(3)), hydrogen cyanide (HCN), siderophore, phosphate solubilization and antifungal activity. More than 80% of the isolates of Azotobacter, fluorescent Pseudomonas and Mesorhizobium ciceri produced IAA, whereas only 20% of Bacillus isolates was IAA producer. Solubilization of phosphate was commonly detected in the isolates of Bacillus (80%) followed by Azotobacter (74.47%), Pseudomonas (55.56%) and Mesorhizobium (16.67%). All test isolates could produce ammonia but none of the isolates hydrolyzed chitin. Siderophore production and antifungal activity of these isolates except Mesorhizobium were exhibited by 10-12.77% isolates. HCN production was more common trait of Pseudomonas (88.89%) and Bacillus (50%). On the basis of multiple plant growth promoting activities, eleven bacterial isolates (seven Azotobacter, three Pseudomonas and one Bacillus) were evaluated for their quantitative IAA production, and broad-spectrum (active against three test fungi) antifungal activity. Almost at all concentration of tryptophan (50-500 microg/ml), IAA production was highest in the Pseudomonas followed by Azotobacter and Bacillus isolates. Azotobacter isolates (AZT(3), AZT(13), AZT(23)), Pseudomonas (Ps(5)) and Bacillus (B(1)) showed broad-spectrum antifungal activity on Muller-Hinton medium against Aspergillus, one or more species of Fusarium and Rhizoctonia bataticola. Further evaluation of the isolates exhibiting multiple plant growth promoting (PGP) traits on soil-plant system is needed to uncover their efficacy as effective PGPR.
16838294	A conserved role for the nodal signaling pathway in the establishment of dorso-ventral and left-right axes in deuterostomes.	Nodal factors play crucial roles during embryogenesis of chordates. They have been implicated in a number of developmental processes, including mesoderm and endoderm formation and patterning of the embryo along the anterior-posterior and left-right axes. We have analyzed the function of the Nodal signaling pathway during the embryogenesis of the sea urchin, a non-chordate organism. We found that Nodal signaling plays a central role in axis specification in the sea urchin, but surprisingly, its first main role appears to be in ectoderm patterning and not in specification of the endoderm and mesoderm germ layers as in vertebrates. Starting at the early blastula stage, sea urchin nodal is expressed in the presumptive oral ectoderm where it controls the formation of the oral-aboral axis. A second conserved role for nodal signaling during vertebrate evolution is its involvement in the establishment of left-right asymmetries. Sea urchin larvae exhibit profound left-right asymmetry with the formation of the adult rudiment occurring only on the left side. We found that a nodal/lefty/pitx2 gene cassette regulates left-right asymmetry in the sea urchin but that intriguingly, the expression of these genes is reversed compared to vertebrates. We have shown that Nodal signals emitted from the right ectoderm of the larva regulate the asymmetrical morphogenesis of the coelomic pouches by inhibiting rudiment formation on the right side of the larva. This result shows that the mechanisms responsible for patterning the left-right axis are conserved in echinoderms and that this role for nodal is conserved among the deuterostomes. We will discuss the implications regarding the reference axes of the sea urchin and the ancestral function of the nodal gene in the last section of this review.
16891103	A type-1 metacaspase from Acanthamoeba castellanii.	The complete sequence of a type-1 metacaspase from Acanthamoeba castellanii is reported comprising 478 amino acids. The metacaspase was recovered from an expression library using sera specific for membrane components implicated in stimulating encystation. A central domain of 155 amino acid residues contains the Cys/His catalytic dyad and is the most conserved region containing at least 30 amino acid identities in all metacaspases. The Acanthamoeba castellanii metacaspase has the most proline-rich N-terminus so far reported in type-1 metacaspases with over 40 prolines in the first 150 residues. Ala-Pro-Pro is present 11 times. Phylogenies constructed using only the conserved proteolytic domains or the complete sequences show identical branching patterns, differing only in the rates of change.
17006532	Quantitative and evolutionary biology of alternative splicing: how changing the mix of alternative transcripts affects phenotypic plasticity and reaction norms.	Alternative splicing (AS) of pre-messenger RNA is a common phenomenon that creates different transcripts from a single gene, and these alternative transcripts affect phenotypes. The majority of AS research has examined tissue and developmental specificity of expression of particular AS transcripts, how this specificity affects cell function, and how aberrant AS is related to disease. Few studies have examined quantitative between-individual variation in AS within a cell or tissue type, or in relation to phenotypes, but the results are compelling: quantitative variation in AS affects plastic traits such as stress, anxiety, fear, egg production, muscle performance, energetics and plant growth. Genomic analyses of AS are also at a nascent stage, but have revealed a number of significant evolutionary patterns. Growing knowledge of upstream genes and kinases that regulate AS provides the as-yet little explored potential to examine how these genes and pathways respond to environmental and genotype variables. Research in this area can provide glimpses of a labyrinth of genetic architectures that have rarely been considered in evolutionary and organismal biology, or in quantitative genetics. The scarcity of contribution to knowledge about AS from these fields is illustrated by the fact that heritability of quantitative variation in AS has not yet been determined for any gene in any organism. New research tactics that incorporate quantitative analyses of AS will allow organismal and evolutionary biologists to attain a fuller mechanistic understanding of many of the traits they study, and may lead to more rapid discovery of functionally important polymorphisms.
17055509	Development and validation of the Chinese version of the Diabetes Management Self-efficacy Scale.	OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to translate the Diabetes Management Self-Efficacy Scale (DMSES) into Chinese and test the validity and reliability of the instrument within a Taiwanese population. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A two-stage design was used for this study. Stage I consisted of a multi-stepped process of forward and backward translation, using focus groups and consensus meetings to translate the 20-item Australia/English version DMSES to Chinese and test content validity. Stage II established the psychometric properties of the Chinese version DMSES (C-DMSES) by examining the criterion, convergent and construct validity, internal consistency and stability testing. The sample for Stage II comprised 230 patients with type 2 diabetes aged 30 years or more from a diabetes outpatient clinic in Taiwan. RESULTS: Three items were modified to better reflect Chinese practice. The C-DMSES obtained a total average CVI score of .86. The convergent validity of the C-DMSES correlated well with the validated measure of the General Self-Efficacy Scale in measuring self-efficacy (r=.55; p<.01). Criterion-related validity showed that the C-DMSES was a significant predictor of the Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities scores (Beta=.58; t=10.75, p<.01). Factor analysis supported the C-DMSES being composed of four subscales. Good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha=.77 to .93) and test-retest reliability (Pearson correlation coefficient r=.86, p<.01) were found. CONCLUSIONS: The C-DMSES is a brief and psychometrically sound measure for evaluation of self-efficacy towards management of diabetes by persons with type 2 diabetes in Chinese populations.
17070090	The initial effects of a Mulligan's mobilization with movement technique on range of movement and pressure pain threshold in pain-limited shoulders.	There is little known about the specific manual therapy techniques used to treat painfully limited shoulders and their effects on range of movement (ROM) and pressure pain threshold (PPT). The objective of this study was to investigate the initial effects of a Mulligan's mobilization with movement (MWM) technique on shoulder ROM in the plane of the scapula and PPT in participants with anterior shoulder pain. A repeated measures, double-blind randomized-controlled trial with a crossover design was conducted with 24 subjects (11 males and 13 females). ROM and PPT were measured before and after the application of MWM, sham and control conditions. Significant and clinically meaningful improvements in both ROM (15.3%, F (2,46)=16.31 P=0.00) and PPT (20.2%, F(2,46)=3.44, P=0.04) occurred immediately after post treatment. The results indicate that this specific manual therapy treatment has an immediate positive effect on both ROM and pain in subjects with painful limitation of shoulder movement. Further study is needed to evaluate the duration of such effects and the mechanism by which this occurs.
17089077	Medical school application interview score has limited predictive validity for performance on a fourth year clinical practice examination.	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: : Data supporting the predictive validity of the medical school admission interview are mixed. This study tested the hypothesis that the admission interview is predictive of interpersonal interactions between medical students and standardized patients. METHOD: : We determined correlations between admission interview scores and performance on a senior-year Clinical Practice Examination piloting US National Board of Medical Examiners stations. We also completed regression analyses controlling for undergraduate academic performance, gender and ethnicity. Outcome measures included an Interpersonal Skills score and a separate Overall Checklist performance score, completed by standardized patients. RESULTS: : The applicant interview had limited but statistically significant correlation with the Interpersonal Skills (r = 0.15; p < 0.05) score. The applicant interview had a correlation of 0.13 with the Overall Checklist score (p = .056). In linear regression models, the applicant interview had limited but statistically significant correlations with the Interpersonal Skills score and the Overall Checklist score. CONCLUSION: : As practiced at this medical school, the admission interview has limited predictive validity for future interactions with standardized patients. More comprehensive assessment of interpersonal skills during the medical school selection process will be needed in order to better select matriculants with desirable interpersonal skills.
17098331	Levodopa increases memory encoding and dopamine release in the striatum in the elderly.	Normal aging is associated with a decrease in dopaminergic function and a reduced ability to form new motor memories with training. This study examined the link between both phenomena. We hypothesized that levodopa would (a) ameliorate aging-dependent deficits in motor memory formation, and (b) increase dopamine availability at the dopamine type 2-like (D2) receptor during training in task-relevant brain structures. The effects of training plus levodopa (100mg, plus 25mg carbidopa) on motor memory formation and striatal dopamine availability were measured with [(11)C]raclopride (RAC) positron emission tomography (PET). We found that levodopa did not alter RAC-binding potential at rest but it enhanced training effects on motor memory formation as well as dopamine release in the dorsal caudate nucleus. Motor memory formation during training correlated with the increase of dopamine release in the caudate nucleus. These results demonstrate that levodopa may ameliorate dopamine deficiencies in the elderly by replenishing dopaminergic presynaptic stores, actively engaged in phasic dopamine release during motor training.
17115153	Evaluation of the utility of the Ponseti method of correction of clubfoot deformity in a developing nation.	Clubfoot is the commonest congenital deformity in babies. More than 100,000 babies are born worldwide each year with congenital clubfoot. Around 80% of the cases occur in developing nations. We treated 154 feet [mean Pirani score (total) 5.57] in 96 children (78 males, 18 females) by the Ponseti method from January 2003 to December 2005. A prospective follow-up for a mean duration of 19.5 months (range 6-32 months) was undertaken. After six months of treatment the Pirani score was reduced to zero for all patients. The results show that corrective surgery, sometimes multiple, can be avoided in most cases which are usually associated with the development of a stiff, painful foot. Low socio-economic status and illiteracy prevailing in developing nations increases the prevalence of neglected clubfoot that is still harder to correct. Integration into various programs and proper use of available resources can decrease neglected clubfoot and improve chances of successful and timely correction of deformity. Bracing constitutes an important part of treatment and proper motivation and education of the parents mitigates the chances of losing correction. The Ponseti method of correcting clubfoot is especially important in developing countries, where operative facilities are not available in the remote areas and well-trained physicians and personnel can manage the cases effectively with cast treatment only.
17126033	Mechanical and morphological properties of the triceps surae muscle-tendon unit in old and young adults and their interaction with a submaximal fatiguing contraction.	The purposes of this study were to examine (a) whether the morphological properties of the muscle gastrocnemius medialis (GM) contribute to the known enhanced muscle fatigue resistance during submaximal sustained isometric plantar flexion contraction of old compared to young adults and (b) whether a submaximal fatiguing contraction differently affects the mechanical properties of the GM tendon and aponeurosis of old and young adults. Fourteen old and 12 young male subjects performed maximal voluntary isometric plantar flexions (MVC) on a dynamometer before and after a submaximal fatiguing task (40% MVC). Moments and EMG signals from the gastrocnemius medialis and lateralis, soleus and tibialis anterior muscles were measured. The elongation of the GM tendon and aponeurosis and the morphological properties of its contractile element were examined by means of ultrasonography. The old adults showed lower maximal ankle joint moment, stiffness and fascicle length in both tested conditions. The submaximal fatiguing contraction did not affect the force-strain relationship of the GM tendon and aponeurosis of either young or old adults. The time to task failure was longer for the old adults and was strongly correlated with the fascicle length (r(2)=0.50, P<0.001). This provides evidence on that the lower ratio of the active muscle volume to muscle force for the old adults might be an additional mechanism contributing to the known age related increase in muscle fatigue resistance.
17134873	Dissimilarity and the classification of male singing voices.	Traditionally, timbre has been defined as that perceptual attribute that differentiates two sounds when pitch and loudness are equal, and thus is a measure of dissimilarity. By such a definition, each voice possesses a set of timbres, and the ability to identify any voice or voice category across different pitch-loudness-vowel combinations must be due to an ability to "link" these timbres by abstracting the "timbre transformation," the manner in which timbre subtly changes across pitch and loudness for a specific voice or voice category. Using stimuli produced across the singing range by singers from different voice categories, this study sought to examine how timbre and pitch interact in the perception of dissimilarity in male singing voices. This study also investigated whether or not listener experience affects the perception of timbre as a function of pitch. The resulting multidimensional scaling (MDS) representations showed that for all stimuli and listeners, dimension 1 correlated with pitch, while dimension 2 correlated with spectral centroid and separated vocal stimuli into the categories baritone and tenor. Dimension 3 appeared highly idiosyncratic depending on the nature of the stimuli and on the experience of the listener. Inexperienced listeners appeared to rely more heavily on pitch in making dissimilarity judgments than did experienced listeners. The resulting MDS representations of dissimilarity across pitch provide a glimpse of the timbre transformation of voice categories across pitch.
17139702	On the exact interval estimation for the difference in paired areas under the ROC curves.	An important measure for comparison of accuracy between two diagnostic procedures is the difference in paired areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Non-parametric and maximum likelihood methods have been proposed for interval estimation for the difference in paired areas under ROC curves. However, these two methods are asymptotic procedures and their performance in finite sample sizes has not been thoroughly investigated. We propose to use the concept of generalized pivotal quantities (GPQs) to construct an exact confidence interval for the difference in paired areas under ROC curves. A simulation study is conducted to empirically investigate the probability coverage and expected length of the three methods for various combinations of sample sizes, values of the area under the ROC curve and correlations. Simulation results demonstrate that the exact confidence interval based on the concept of GPQs provides not only sufficient probability coverage but also reasonable expected length. Numerical examples using published data sets illustrate the proposed method.
17152085	Investigating divergent mechanisms of mesoderm development in arthropods: the expression of Ph-twist and Ph-mef2 in Parhyale hawaiensis.	The evolution of mesoderm was important for the development of complex body plans as well as key organ systems. Genetic and molecular studies in the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster, have provided the majority of information concerning mesoderm development in arthropods. In Drosophila, twist is necessary for the specification and correct morphogenesis of mesoderm and myocyte enhancing factor 2 (mef2) is involved downstream of twist to activate muscle differentiation. In Drosophila, mesoderm is defined by positional cues in the blastoderm embryo, while in another arthropod group, the amphipod crustaceans, cell lineage plays a greater role in defining the mesoderm. It is not known how different mechanistic strategies such as positional information vs. cell-lineage-dependent development affect the timing and use of gene networks. Here we describe the development of the mesoderm in a malacostracan crustacean, Parhyale hawaiensis, and characterize the expression of Parhyale twist and mef2 orthologues. In Parhyale, the mesoderm of the post-mandibular segments arises mainly through the asymmetric division of mesoteloblasts as the germband elongates. Ph-twist expression is seen in a subset of segmental mesoderm during germband development, but not during early cleavages when the specific mesodermal cell lineages first arise. ph-mef2 expression starts after the segmental mesoderm begins to proliferate and persists in developing musculature. While the association of these genes with mesoderm differentiation appears to be conserved across the animal kingdom, the timing of expression and relationship with different mechanisms of mesoderm development may give us greater insight into the ancestral use of these genes during mesoderm differentiation.
17157849	The use of the life course paradigm and life course charts to explore referral for family history of breast cancer.	BACKGROUND: Life course research methodologies are used extensively in historical and social science research. In 1998 the life course paradigm was introduced to provide a way of tracing the interplay of person and setting. The method has had a very limited use in nursing research, but in this study it was utilized as a way of capturing dynamic change by placing the individual within a context of four domains; location in time and place, linked lives, human agency and timing of lives. OBJECTIVE: To describe the paradigm, review its use in healthcare research and provide a specific example of its use in healthcare. DESIGN: This paper discusses a novel method of creating life course charts for a qualitative study exploring the differing experiences of women referred from primary care to specialist services due to a family history of breast cancer. SETTING: A nurse-led breast cancer family history clinic in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-two women. METHODS: Life charts were used in conjunction with a grounded theory approach to analyse data collected from semi-structured interviews. FINDINGS: Twenty-two life charts were created and the ability to layer the charts of multiple women to visualise similarities and differences aided the analysis. The life charts were a useful tool in the development of theoretical understandings and the psychosocial process of realisation of risk emerged as central to the initiation of referral. This was often apparent when approaching the age of an affected relative (anticipated onset) or when current circumstances emulate past experience (generational transference). CONCLUSIONS: This approach to charting complex psychological, social and contextual factors throughout the life course was methodologically beneficial and could have a wider utility in nursing and healthcare research. As a research tool it enhanced a holistic approach to patient care issues and was helpful as an aid to understanding health behaviours linked to familial risk.
17161401	Reliability and validity of the Icelandic version of the Problem Area in Diabetes (PAID) Scale.	BACKGROUND: Diabetes is a burdensome disease that increases distress among people with diabetes. OBJECTIVES: To test the validity and reliability of an Icelandic version of the problem area in diabetes scale (PAID) and to assess the hitherto unknown distress level of Icelandic people with insulin requiring diabetes. DESIGN: Methodological research design. SETTING: Diabetes clinics. PARTICIPANTS: People with insulin-dependent diabetes, between 18 and 61 years. METHODS: All instruments were translated using a back-translation technique. Participants answered three consecutive questionnaires in succession, the PAID scale, the diabetes empowerment scale (DES) and the diabetes knowledge test (DKT). Principical component analysis with varimax rotation was conducted on the PAID scale to identify latent factors. RESULTS: Factor analysis revealed two factors: (a) distress in relation to life with diabetes, with Cronbach alpha coefficient of 0.93 and (b) distress in relation to management of diabetes, with Cronbach alpha coefficient of 0.88, for PAID overall Cronbach alpha coefficient was 0.94. PAID showed neither floor nor ceilings effects. Propositions set to indicate validity were generally met. However, PAID's factor structure and predictive validity needs to be tested further. CONCLUSIONS: The Icelandic version of PAID is sufficiently psychometrically robust. PAID is simple to administer and by using the scale clinicians can identify people at risk for developing diabetes-related distress. The results are comparable to results from studies in other countries using the PAID scale.
17161607	Karyotypic similarity among Barycholos ternetzi and five species of the genus Eleutherodactylus from southeastern Brazil (Anura, Brachycephalidae).	Comparative cytogenetic analyses were carried out in six species of Brachycephalidae from southeastern Brazil. Barycholos ternetzi, Eleutherodactylus binotatus, Eleutherodactylus guentheri, Eleutherodactylus juipoca, Eleutherodactylus parvus and Eleutherodactylus sp. have 2n=22 karyotypes with a marked variation in the morphology of chromosome pairs 8, 10 and 11, which are of telocentric or metacentric types, resulting in FN=38, 40 and 44. Eleutherodactylus have a single chromosome pair bearing Ag-NOR, i.e. pair 1 in E. binotatus, pair 6 in E. guentheri and E. parvus, and pair 11 in E. juipoca and Eleutherodactylus sp. In contrast, B. ternetzi showed Ag-positive sites in the chromosome pairs 1, 4, 5, 9 and 11, and only one to three labelings per metaphase in each individual. Nevertheless, the main chromosome pair with Ag-NOR in the species seems to be the 11th, like in E. juipoca and Eleutherodactylus sp. The NOR site was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique in E. binotatus and in B. ternetzi, bearing 1p1p and 9p11p11p Ag-NOR pattern, respectively. All the species exhibited predominantly centromeric C-banding pattern, but interstitial bands have also been observed in some cases. In E. binotatus, there is an indication of geographical difference in the distribution of the interstitial C-bands. The fluorochromes GC-specific chromomycin A(3) (CMA(3)) and AT-specific 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), with distamycin A (DA) counterstaining, provided the molecular content of some repetitive regions in the karyotypes of the species. One male of E. binotatus presented an extensive heteromorphism, involving at least five different pairs, probably as a consequence of multiple reciprocal translocations. Such rearrangements might be responsible for the multivalent chain seen in the meiosis of this specimen, as well as in another male, although not exhibiting chromosome heteromorphism. The remaining males and those belonging to the other species have always shown 11 bivalents in diplotene and metaphase I cells. In all male specimens, metaphases II presented 11 chromosomes. Despite the observed discrepancies, the five species of Eleutherodactylus have a great uniformity in the 2n=22 karyotypes, suggesting an assemblage of species from southeastern and southern Brazil, in contrast to northern and northeastern assemblage which is characterized by higher diploid numbers. Undoubtedly, B. ternetzi could be included in that proposed assemblage, due to its karyotypic similarity with the Eleutherodactylus species, as evidenced in the present study. This fact strongly supports the close relationships of both genera, previously inferred on the basis of several characters shared by their species.
17216358	Mate retention behavior of men and women in heterosexual and homosexual relationships.	Comparing the behavior of heterosexual and homosexual persons can provide insight into the origins of heterosexual sex differences in psychology. Evidence indicates that, aside from sexual partner preference, the mating psychology of homosexual men is sex-typical whereas that of homosexual women tends to be more sex-atypical. The current study examined one aspect of mating psychology, mate retention behavior, and tested whether homosexual men and women were sex-typical or sex-atypical for those mate retention tactics where heterosexual men and women differed. Men and women in heterosexual and homosexual relationships were asked to provide information regarding their partners' mate retention behavior by using the Mate Retention Inventory Questionnaire. Heterosexual men and women differed significantly for six of the 19 mate retention tactics considered. With respect to the six mate retention tactics where heterosexual sex differences existed, homosexual men behaved in a sex-typical manner for five of the tactics, whereas homosexual women behaved in a sex-atypical manner for all six tactics. We discuss the significance of these findings for explaining the origins of the mate retention behavior of heterosexual men and women. In addition, we consider what the pattern of sex-typical and sex-atypical mating psychology among homosexual men and women, respectively, suggests in regard to sex differences in the development of mating psychology and the development of homosexual persons.
17265535	Apolipoprotein E phylogeny and evolution.	Among apolipoproteins, apolipoprotein E (Apo E) plays a pivotal role in lipid transport and is proposed to be involved in neural repair. Because of a long divergence history of apolipoproteins, it is unclear how Apo E evolved in time. To investigate relationships among Apo E proteins, we used the information from molecular data and analysed the phylogeny of Apo E proteins from various species. Several phylogenetic trees were generated by using both character-based and distance-based phylogenetic methods. Apo E sequences of fish and frog were found to be less related to the Apo E sequences of other species. The most likely ancestor of Apo E among 18 organisms was estimated to be the Apo E of frog. Members of the groups formed by the Apo E proteins of various species shared similar feeding habits and diet. It may be suggested that Apo E evolution and very likely the evolution of other apolipoproteins are influenced by the organism's feeding environment and diet.
17275160	Goals and remedial strategies for water quality and wildlife management in a coastal lagoon--a case-study of Ringkøbing Fjord, Denmark.	The aim of this work is (1) to discuss approaches and tools to set management goals using operational indicators for coastal management (i.e., indicators that are easy to measure, understand and predict) and validated predictive models and (2) to discuss remedial strategies for sustainable coastal management regarding water quality and the abundance of fish, waterfowl and large aquatic plants. These approaches are exemplified using data from Ringkøbing Fjord, Denmark, which has undergone two major regime shifts during the last decades. This work discusses the changes taken place during the period from 1980 to 2004 (when there are good empirical data). For Ringkøbing Fjord, which is a very shallow, well-oxygenated lagoon dominated by resuspension processes, we have targeted on the following operational indicators, which are meant to reflect seasonal median values for the entire defined coastal area (the ecosystem scale) and not conditions at individual sites or data from shorter time periods: Secchi depth (as a standard measure of water clarity) and chlorophyll-a concentrations (as a key measure of algal biomass). The operational indicators are regulated by a set of standard abiotic factors, such as salinity, suspended particulate matter (SPM), nutrient concentrations (N and P), coastal morphometry and water exchange. Such relationships are quantified using well-tested, general quantitative models, which illustrate how these indicators are interrelated and how they reflect fundamental aspects of coastal ecosystems. We demonstrate that the regime shift in the lagoon can be modelled and quantitatively explained and is related to changes in salinity and nutrient inflow. A very important threshold is linked to increased salinities in the lagoon. For example, when the mean annual salinity is higher than about 9.5 per thousand, large numbers of saltwater species of clams can survive and influence the structure and function of the ecosystem in profound ways. The model also illustrates the dynamic response to changes in nutrient loading. We have presented several management strategies with the goal of keeping the Secchi depth at 2m, which would stimulate the growth of higher aquatic plants, which are fundamental for fish production and bird abundance in the lagoon. Given the fact that the Secchi depth depends on many variable factors (temperature, TP-inflow from land, salinity, changes in biomasses of macrophytes and clams, which are accounted for in these simulations), our results indicate that in practice it will likely be very difficult to reach that goal. However, it would be realistic to maintain a Secchi depth of 1.5m if the variability in salinity is minimized and the mean salinity is kept at about 10.2%.
17276578	Economic and policy instrument analyses in support of the scrap tire recycling program in Taiwan.	Understanding the cost-effectiveness and the role of economic and policy instruments, such as the combined product tax-recycling subsidy scheme or a tradable permit, for scrap tire recycling has been of crucial importance in a market-oriented environmental management system. Promoting product (tire) stewardship on one hand and improving incentive-based recycling policy on the other hand requires a comprehensive analysis of the interfaces and interactions in the nexus of economic impacts, environmental management, environmental valuation, and cost-benefit analysis. This paper presents an assessment of the interfaces and interactions between the implementation of policy instruments and its associated economic evaluation for sustaining a scrap tire recycling program in Taiwan during the era of the strong economic growth of the late 1990s. It begins with an introduction of the management of the co-evolution between technology metrics of scrap tire recycling and organizational changes for meeting the managerial goals island-wide during the 1990s. The database collected and used for such analysis covers 17 major tire recycling firms and 10 major tire manufacturers at that time. With estimates of scrap tire generation and possible scale of subsidy with respect to differing tire recycling technologies applied, economic analysis eventually leads to identify the associated levels of product tax with respect to various sizes of new tires. It particularly demonstrates a broad perspective of how an integrated econometric and engineering economic analysis can be conducted to assist in implementing policy instruments for scrap tire management. Research findings indicate that different subsidy settings for collection, processing, and end use of scrap tires should be configured to ameliorate the overall managerial effectiveness. Removing the existing boundaries between designated service districts could strengthen the competitiveness of scrap tires recycling industry, helping to reduce the required levels of product tax and subsidy. With such initial breakthroughs at hand to handle the complexity of scrap tire recycling technologies, there remains unique management and policy avenues left to explore if a multi-dimensional solution is to be successful in the long run.
17296273	Induced seasonal reproductive performance in two breeds of sheep.	The objective of the present experiment was to determine whether failure to become pregnant through out-of-season reproductive management regimes is attributable to a failure to stimulate normal corpora lutea (CL) production. Romney ewes and East Friesian Composite (EF) ewes were mated in summer, autumn, winter, and early and late spring after administration of intravaginal progesterone inserts (plus eCG in spring and summer) in a factorial (two breedsxfive mating periods) experimental design. Oestrus rate was determined from mating data, and the numbers of CL were determined by laparoscopy 9 days after ram introduction. Conception rate, pregnancy rate and litter size were determined by transabdominal ultrasonography 62 days after ram introduction. Proportions of ewes displaying oestrus did not differ significantly (75-100%) between seasons or breeds, except for the Romney ewes in summer (67%; P<0.05). Numbers of CL on Day 9 for EF ewes was lowest in autumn (1.5) and winter (1.5), and highest in late spring (2.1; P<0.05). In contrast, Romney ewes had the lowest CL count in summer (1.3), and the highest in autumn (1.8) and winter (1.6; P<0.05). Only in summer was there a difference between breeds (EF 1.8; Romney 1.3; P<0.01). The proportion of ewes that failed to conceive despite having one or more CL present was highest in late spring (EF 41%, Romney 43%), and lowest in autumn (EF 9%, Romney 4%) and winter (EF 14%, Romney 4%; P<0.05). Conception and pregnancy rates followed similar patterns with values for autumn (EF 91%, 91%; Romney 96%, 96%) and June (EF 86%, 82%; Romney 91%, 83%) being significantly (P<0.05) higher than in early (EF 50%, 40%; Romney 54%, 50%) and late spring (EF 44%, 36%; Romney 42%, 36%). Pregnancy rate in summer was higher for EF ewes (60%) than for Romney ewes (39%) but conception rates were not statistically different (EF 68%; Romney 60%). Numbers of foetuses identified at scanning was highest in autumn (1.5) and lowest in late spring (0.5 P<0.001): Litter size in pregnant EF ewes was highest in early spring and lowest in winter (1.8 versus 1.2; P<0.01), but for pregnant Romney ewes was highest in winter and lowest in early spring (1.9 versus 1.3; P<0.001). It was concluded that seasonal differences in the ability of ewes to conceive are not the consequence of failure to display oestrus or to ovulate, but probably are a result of failure of fertilisation or the establishment of pregnancy.
17304254	Glaucoma phenotype in a large Swiss pedigree with the myocilin Gly367Arg mutation.	AIMS: To characterize genotype, phenotype, and age-related penetrance in a Swiss pedigree with juvenile open-angle glaucoma (JOAG). METHODS: In a large Swiss family with history of glaucoma and 82 living members of four generations, we conducted molecular analysis and a detailed phenotype characterization in 52 family members. Mutation analysis was carried out using single-strand conformation polymorphism and DNA sequence analyses of the suspected candidate gene, myocilin (MYOC). RESULTS: We detected a Gly367Arg mutation in the MYOC gene of 13 family members. Nine of them (69.2%) had glaucoma: mean IOP 35.3 mm Hg, range 24-50 mm Hg; mean age at diagnosis 34.9 years, range 28-51 years. Two mutation carriers were glaucoma suspects, one (age 15) was unaffected, and one (age 16) not available for clinical examinations. Age-related glaucoma penetrance was 50% at 30 and 78% at 40. Untreated IOP resulted in rapid disease progression, whereas good IOP control, usually only by means of filtration surgery, could stabilize the disease. None of the wild-type members had glaucoma. CONCLUSIONS: This Swiss family is the largest reported Gly367Arg pedigree to date. The exact genotype and phenotype characterization allowed a reliable risk and prognosis assessment and targeted eye-care planning for the family. The study demonstrates the importance of genetic investigations in glaucoma families, carrying the potential of long-term socio-economic benefits.
17311358	Frequency of single nucleotide polymorphisms of CYP2D6 in the Czech population.	CYP2D6 is a member of cytochrome P450 enzymes that metabolise over 25% of commonly used drugs. Genetic polymorphisms can cause insufficient drug efficacy at usually administered doses or can be the cause of adverse drug reaction. CYP2D6 genotyping can be used to predict CYP2D6 phenotype and thereby explain some abnormalities in drug response and thus optimize pharmacotherapy. The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of functionally important variant alleles of the CYP2D6 gene throughout the Czech population to predict the prevalence of ultra-rapid and poor metabolizer phenotypes. The DNA of 223 unrelated, healthy volunteers was analysed to detect the presence of CYP2D6*6, *5, *4, *3 and gene duplication. The variant allele frequencies in our population were 0.22%, 3.14%, 22.87%, 1.12% and 3.14% for CYP2D6*6, CYP2D6*5, CYP2D6*4, CYP2D6*3 and CYP2D6*MxN, respectively. Fifteen subjects carried two variant alleles leading to predicted poor type of metabolism, 84 subjects were heterozygous extensive metabolizers (het-EM). The full-text contains detailed comparison with European white populations. The distribution of variant alleles complies with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The frequencies of functional variant alleles of CYP2D6 in Czech population are in concordance with other Caucasian populations.
17318833	Acute modulation of cortical oscillatory activities during short trains of high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation of the human motor cortex: a combined EEG and TMS study.	In this study, a combined repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation/electroencephalography (rTMS/EEG) method was used to explore the acute changes of cortical oscillatory activity induced by intermittent short trains of high-frequency (5-Hz) rTMS delivered over the left primary motor cortex (M1). We evaluated the electrophysiological reaction to magnetic stimulation during and 2-4 s after 20 trains of 20-pulses rTMS, using event-related power (ERPow) that reflects the regional oscillatory activity of neural assemblies, and event-related coherence (ERCoh) that reflects the interregional functional connectivity of oscillatory neural activity. These event-related transformations were for the upper alpha (10-12 Hz) and beta (18-22 Hz) frequency ranges, respectively. For the alpha band, threshold rTMS and subthreshold rTMS induced an ERPow increase during the trains of stimulation mainly in frontal and central regions ipsilateral to stimulation. For the beta band, a similar synchronization of cortical oscillations for both rTMS intensities was seen. Moreover, subthreshold rTMS affected alpha-band activity more than threshold rTMS, inducing a specific ERCoh decrease over the posterior regions during the trains of stimulation. For beta band, the decrease in functional coupling was observed mainly during threshold rTMS. These findings provide a better understanding of the cortical effects of high-frequency rTMS, whereby the induction of oscillations reflects the capacity of electromagnetic pulses to alter regional and interregional synaptic transmissions of neural populations.
17320339	Expression of lactoferrin in the boar epididymis: effects of reduced estrogen.	Lactoferrin is regulated by estrogen in the female reproductive tract and evidence in immature mice suggests that it may be estrogen regulated in males as well. The estrogen regulation of lactoferrin in the epididymis of the boar, a high estrogen-producing male, is unknown. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that lactoferrin expression in the boar epididymis is regulated by estrogen. Twenty-one littermate pairs of boars were treated with vehicle or Letrozole, an aromatase inhibitor, from 1 week of age until castration at 2 through 8 months. Epididymal tissue was collected at castration and fixed for immunolocalization of lactoferrin. Epididymal and testicular tissues were also collected from five mature boars (1-2.5 years) and fixed for immunocytochemistry (ICC). Lactoferrin was localized in the principal cell cytoplasm of the caput, corpus and cauda of developing boars but only in the corpus and cauda of mature boars. Basal cells were negative for lactoferrin. Sperm in the corpus and cauda was also positive for lactoferrin. The efferent ducts and testes were negative for lactoferrin. Intensity of lactoferrin immunostaining increased with age in the corpus and cauda regardless of treatment. Reduced endogenous estrogen in the epididymis during development did not affect the intensity of immunostaining between control and Letrozole-treated animals. Lactoferrin expression in the epididymis of the developing boar does not appear to be regulated by estrogen.
17333332	A randomized controlled trial of a decision aid for women considering genetic testing for breast and ovarian cancer risk.	PURPOSE: To measure the effectiveness of a tailored decision aid (DA) designed to help women make informed decisions about genetic testing for breast/ovarian cancer risk. METHODS: A total of 145 women were randomized to receive the DA or a control pamphlet at the end of their first genetic counseling consultation. Of these, 120 (82.8%) completed two questionnaires, 1 week and 6 months post-consultation. RESULTS: While the DA had no effect on informed choice, post-decisional regret or actual genetic testing decision, the trial showed that women who received the DA had higher knowledge levels and felt more informed about genetic testing than women who received the control pamphlet (chi(2)(2) = 6.82; P = 0.033; chi(2)(1) = 4.86; P = 0.028 respectively). The DA also helped women who did not have blood drawn at their first consultation to clarify their values with regards to genetic testing (chi(2)(1) = 5.27; P = 0.022). Women who received the DA were less likely to share the information with other family members than women in the control condition (chi(2)(1) = 8.78; P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Decision aids are an effective decision-support strategy for women considering genetic testing for breast/ovarian cancer risk, and are most effective before the patient has made a decision, which is generally at the point of having blood drawn.
17336037	An Internet-based investigation of the catastrophic misinterpretation model of panic disorder.	The catastrophic misinterpretation (CM) model of panic disorder proposes that spontaneous panic attacks are the result of interpretation of harmless autonomic arousal as precursors to physical (e.g., heart attack) or psychological (e.g., insanity) emergency. Mixed research findings to date have provided equivocal support. The body sensations interpretation questionnaire-modified was administered via Internet to investigate core assumptions of the model among 30 people with panic disorder (PD), 28 with social anxiety disorder (SAD), and 30 non-anxious controls. The PD group gave more harm-related interpretations of ambiguous internal stimuli than both other groups, and this tendency to interpret ambiguous stimuli catastrophically was not also apparent for external/general events. Furthermore, people with PD rated harm and anxiety outcomes as more catastrophic than non-anxious controls. Results substantially support the CM model although a modification is proposed.
17349731	Using a choice experiment to measure the environmental costs of air pollution impacts in Seoul.	Air pollution, a by-product of economic growth, has been incurring extensive environmental costs in Seoul, Korea. Unfortunately, air pollution impacts are not treated as a commercial item, and thus it is difficult to measure the environmental costs arising from air pollution. There is an imminent need to find a way to measure air pollution impacts so that appropriate actions can be taken to control air pollution. Therefore, this study attempts to apply a choice experiment to quantifying the environmental costs of four air pollution impacts (mortality, morbidity, soiling damage, and poor visibility), using a specific case study of Seoul. We consider the trade-offs between price and attributes of air pollution impacts for selecting a preferred alternative and derive the marginal willingness to pay (WTP) estimate for each attribute. According to the results, the households' monthly WTP for a 10% reduction in the concentrations of major pollutants in Seoul was found to be approximately 5494 Korean won (USD 4.6) and the total annual WTP for the entire population of Seoul was about 203.4 billion Korean won (USD 169.5 million). This study is expected to provide policy-makers with useful information for evaluating and planning environmental policies relating specifically to air pollution.
17350831	Influence of disinfectants on domestic wastewater treatment plant performance.	The inhibition effect of the disinfectants was investigated under laboratory conditions. COD removal, nitrification process and oxygen uptake rate were the observed processes. Disinfectants can be divided into a few groups depending on the present biocides. The results of the experiments showed a significant influence of the disinfectants containing sodium hypochlorite on the activated sludge. Domestos and Savo caused the highest inhibition on the respiration, 99% and 100%, respectively; while Asanox and Clorox had the highest effect on COD removal, 97% and 100%, respectively. Bref duo active, which also contains sodium hypochlorite, caused the lowest inhibition for all observed processes. Disinfectants based on other biocides did not cause significant inhibitions.
17360144	Prediction of non-sentinel node status and outcome in sentinel node-positive melanoma patients.	AIMS: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) -positive melanoma patients are usually recommended completion lymph node dissection (CLND) with the aim to provide regional disease control and improve survival. Nevertheless, only 20% these patients have additional metastases in non-sentinel lymph nodes (NSLN), indicating that CLND may be unnecessary in the majority of patients. In this retrospective study, we (i) sought to identify clinico-pathological features predicting NSLN status, as well as disease-free (DFS) and -specific (DSS) survival and (ii) evaluated the applicability of previously published algorithms, which were able to define a group of patients at zero-risk for NSLN-metastasis. METHODS: This analysis included 504 consecutive melanoma patients stage I and II who underwent successful SLN-biopsy (SLNB) at our institute between 1998 and 2005. Metastatic SLN were re-evaluated for tumor burden and categorized according to two different micro-anatomic classifications and the S/U-score (Size of the sentinel node metastasis > 2 mm/Ulceration of the primary melanoma) was assessed. DFS and DSS were calculated for all analyses. RESULTS: Out of 504 melanoma patients stage I or II, 85 (17%) were SLN-positive and 18 of 85 (21%) were found with positive NSLN in the CLND specimen. Median follow-up was 31 months. Neither primary tumor characteristics (age, gender, Clark level, Breslow thickness, ulceration of the primary melanoma, site and histological subtype of the primary melanoma), nor features of the sentinel node tumor (number and site of draining lymph node basins, number of positive sentinel nodes and size of sentinel node tumor (< 2 mm vs. > or = 2 mm) were able to predict additional positive lymph nodes in the CLND specimen. Likewise the implementation of published algorithms was not able to identify patients at negligible risk for harboring NSLN metastases. Upon univariate analysis, disease-free survival in SLN-positive patients was correlated with Breslow thickness, sentinel node tumor size > 2 mm and S/U score. In respect to disease-specific survival the significant prognostic parameters were Breslow thickness, ulceration, sentinel node tumor size > 2 mm and the S/U score. After a median follow-up of 31 months recurrence rates (37% vs. 78%, p=0.02) and death from disease (24% vs. 50%, p<0.01) were significantly different in patients with SLN-metastasis only as compared to patients with NSLN-metastasis. CONCLUSION: NSLN status cannot be predicted in this data analysis by using clinico-pathological characteristics. Therefore, CLND is recommended for all patients after positive SLNB pending the results of the second Multicenter Selective Lymphadenectomy Trial.
17362956	Addressing the threat of evidence-based practice to qualitative inquiry through increasing attention to quality: a discussion paper.	The current evidence-based practice (EBP) movement in healthcare emphasizes that clinical decision making should be based on the "best evidence" available, preferably the findings of randomized clinical trials. Within this context qualitative research findings are considered to have little value and the old debate in nursing has been re-ignited related to whether qualitative versus quantitative research findings provides the best empirical evidence for nursing practice. In response to this crisis qualitative scholars have been called upon by leaders in the field to clarify for outsiders what qualitative research is and to be more explicit in pointing out the utility of qualitative research findings. In addition, attention to "quality" in qualitative research has been identified as an area worthy of renewed focus. Within this paper two key problems related to addressing these issues are reviewed: disagreement not only among "outsiders" but also some nursing scholars related to the definition of "qualitative research", and a lack of consensus related how to best address "rigor" in this type of inquiry. Based on this review a set of standard requirements for qualitative research published in nursing journals is proposed that reflects a uniform definition of qualitative research and an enlarged yet clearly articulated conceptualization of quality. The approach suggested provides a framework for developing and evaluating qualitative research that would have both defensible scholarly merit and heuristic value. This will help solidify the argument in favor of incorporating qualitative research findings as part of the empirical "evidence" upon which evidence-based nursing is founded.
17380426	Expression of puroindoline a enhances leaf rust resistance in transgenic tetraploid wheat.	The purouindoline gene (pin) coding for puroindoline proteins (PINs) is located on chromosome 5D, controls grain hardness, and the PINs have in vitro antimicrobial activity against gram-positive (G+) bacteria, gram-negative (G-) bacteria and fungi. Wheat leaf rust caused by Puccinia triticina is one of the most important fungal diseases for common wheat with AABBDD genomes. Tetraploid wheat (AABB genome) varieties Luna and Venusia were transformed with the purouindoline a (pinA) gene by bombardment, express PINA consititutively. Transgenic plants showed enhanced response to leaf rust in greenhouse and field. Comparative study of harvesting parameters showed significant differences between transgenic and control plants. These indexes were significantly lower (P < 0.05) in control plants than that in transgenic plants, which suggests that they are significantly affected by pinA gene and that the puroindoline a protein (PINA) can effectively inhibit in vivo the growth of fungal, and the transgenic tetraploid wheat can grow well in Hubei Province, Central China, where the tetraploid wheat varieties Luna and Venusia have poor yield due to their disease-sensitivity.
17383655	What fosters or prevents interprofessional teamworking in primary and community care? A literature review.	BACKGROUND: The increase in prevalence of long-term conditions in Western societies, with the subsequent need for non-acute quality patient healthcare, has brought the issue of collaboration between health professionals to the fore. Within primary care, it has been suggested that multidisciplinary teamworking is essential to develop an integrated approach to promoting and maintaining the health of the population whilst improving service effectiveness. Although it is becoming widely accepted that no single discipline can provide complete care for patients with a long-term condition, in practice, interprofessional working is not always achieved. OBJECTIVES: This review aimed to explore the factors that inhibit or facilitate interprofessional teamworking in primary and community care settings, in order to inform development of multidisciplinary working at the turn of the century. DESIGN: A comprehensive search of the literature was undertaken using a variety of approaches to identify appropriate literature for inclusion in the study. The selected articles used both qualitative and quantitative research methods. FINDINGS: Following a thematic analysis of the literature, two main themes emerged that had an impact on interprofessional teamworking: team structure and team processes. Within these two themes, six categories were identified: team premises; team size and composition; organisational support; team meetings; clear goals and objectives; and audit. The complex nature of interprofessional teamworking in primary care meant that despite teamwork being an efficient and productive way of achieving goals and results, several barriers exist that hinder its potential from becoming fully exploited; implications and recommendations for practice are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: These findings can inform development of current best practice, although further research needs to be conducted into multidisciplinary teamworking at both the team and organisation level, to ensure that enhancement and maintenance of teamwork leads to an improved quality of healthcare provision.
17387512	Serial 1H-MRS in GM2 gangliosidoses.	GM2 gangliosidoses are a group of neuronal storage disorders caused by deficiency in the lysosomal enzyme hexosaminidase A. Clinically, the disease is marked by a relentless encephalopathy. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) provides in-vivo measurement of various brain metabolites including N-acetyl aspartate+N-acetyl aspartate glutamate (NAA), myo-inositol (mI), choline (Cho) and creatine (Cr). The NAA represents neuronal integrity while elevation in the mI reflects abnormal inflammation and gliosis in the brain tissue. An elevation in the Cho levels suggest cell membrane breakdown and demyelination. We report the clinical and laboratory data in two patients with GM2 gangliosidoses. Serial 1H-MRS evaluations were performed to drive metabolite ratios of NAA/Cr, mI/Cr and Cho/Cr. We acquired the data from four regions of interest (ROI) according to a standard protocol. The results documented a progressive elevation in mI/Cr in all four ROI in patient one and only one ROI (occipital gray matter) in patient 2. We also documented a decline in the NAA/Cr ratios in both cases in most ROI. These results were compared to six age-matched controls and confirmed statistically significant elevation in the mI in our cases. In conclusion, 1H-MRS alterations were suggestive of neuronal loss and inflammation in these patients. 1H-MRS may be a valuable tool in monitoring the disease progress and response to therapy in GM2 gangliosidoses. Elevation in the mI may prove to be more sensitive than the other metabolite alterations.
17387627	Enhancing salt tolerance in a crop plant by overexpression of glyoxalase II.	Earlier we have shown the role of glyoxalase overexpression in conferring salinity tolerance in transgenic tobacco. We now demonstrate the feasibility of same in a crop like rice through overproduction of glyoxalase II. The rice glyoxalase II was cloned in pCAMBIA1304 and transformed into rice (Oryza sativa cv PB1) via Agrobacterium. The transgenic plants showed higher constitutive activity of glyoxalase II that increased further upon salt stress, reflecting the upregulation of endogenous glyoxalase II. The transgenic rice showed higher tolerance to toxic concentrations of methylglyoxal (MG) and NaCl. Compared with non-transgenics, transgenic plants at the T1 generation exhibited sustained growth and more favorable ion balance under salt stress conditions.
17392731	Are GABAA receptors containing alpha5 subunits contributing to the sedative properties of benzodiazepine site agonists?	Classical benzodiazepines (BZs) exert anxiolytic, sedative, hypnotic, muscle relaxant, anticonvulsive, and amnesic effects through potentiation of neurotransmission at GABA(A) receptors containing alpha(1), alpha(2), alpha(3) or alpha(5) subunits. Genetic studies suggest that modulation at the alpha(1) subunit contributes to much of the adverse effects of BZs, most notably sedation, ataxia, and amnesia. Hence, BZ site ligands functionally inactive at GABA(A) receptors containing the alpha(1) subunit are considered to be promising leads for novel, anxioselective anxiolytics devoid of sedative properties. In pursuing this approach, we used two-electrode voltage clamp experiments in Xenopus oocytes expressing recombinant GABA(A) receptor subtypes to investigate functional selectivity of three newly synthesized BZ site ligands and also compared their in vivo behavioral profiles. The compounds were functionally selective for alpha(2)-, alpha(3)-, and alpha(5)-containing subtypes of GABA(A) receptors (SH-053-S-CH3 and SH-053-S-CH3-2'F) or essentially selective for alpha(5) subtypes (SH-053-R-CH3). Possible influences on behavioral measures were tested in the elevated plus maze, spontaneous locomotor activity, and rotarod test, which are considered primarily predictive of the anxiolytic, sedative, and ataxic influence of BZs, respectively. The results confirmed the substantially diminished ataxic potential of BZ site agonists devoid of alpha(1) subunit-mediated effects, with preserved anti-anxiety effects at 30 mg/kg of SH-053-S-CH3 and SH-053-S-CH3-2'F. However, all three ligands, dosed at 30 mg/kg, decreased spontaneous locomotor activity, suggesting that sedation may be partly dependent on activity mediated by alpha(5)-containing GABA(A) receptors. Hence, it could be of importance to avoid substantial agonist activity at alpha(5) receptors by candidate anxioselective anxiolytics, if clinical sedation is to be avoided.
17406650	First human evidence of d-amphetamine induced displacement of a D2/3 agonist radioligand: A [11C]-(+)-PHNO positron emission tomography study.	Imaging the competition between D(2/3) radioligands and endogenous dopamine is so far the only way to measure dopamine release in the living human brain. The dopamine D(2) receptor exists in a high (D(2)(high)) and a low-affinity state for dopamine. Under physiological conditions, dopamine is expected to bind to D(2)(high) only. [(11)C]-(+)-4-propyl-9-hydroxynaphthoxazine ((+)-PHNO) is the first D(2/3) agonist radioligand for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in humans. Since [(11)C]-(+)-PHNO is expected to bind preferentially to D(2)(high), it should be particularly vulnerable to competition with endogenous dopamine. Nine healthy subjects participated in two PET scans, one after administration of d-amphetamine and one after placebo. [(11)C]-(+)-PHNO PET test re-test variability was determined in 11 healthy subjects. Binding potentials (BPs) were calculated for caudate, putamen, ventral striatum, and globus pallidus. d-Amphetamine led to a significant decrease of [(11)C]-(+)-PHNO BPs in caudate (-13.2%), putamen (-20.8%), and ventral striatum (-24.9%), but not in globus pallidus (-6.5%). d-Amphetamine-induced displacement correlated with serum d-amphetamine levels in all regions but caudate. This is the first report on competition between endogenous dopamine and a D(2/3) agonist radioligand in humans. [(11)C]-(+)-PHNO PET might be a superior measure for release of endogenous dopamine than PET employing conventional D(2/3) antagonist radioligands.
17417791	False positivity of FDG-PET/CT in a child with Hodgkin disease.	Role of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) with F-18-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) in staging of Hodgkin disease is well established despite several controversies. We report a Stage III Hodgkin lymphoma patient with false positive FDG-PET/CT results. Seven-year-old male with Hodgkin lymphoma was in remission at end of chemotherapy. At third and fourth month of postchemotherapy follow-up, increased Gallium uptake and positive FDG-PET/CT in right lower quadrant of abdomen was observed. Open biopsy revealed lymphoid hyperplasia. He has been followed for 21 months without any evidence of disease. Despite its documented benefit, we believe that results of FDG-PET/CT should be interpreted with great caution in order to avoid unnecessary interventions.
17418193	Postnatal depression and the experience of South Asian marriage migrant women in Taiwan: survey and semi-structured interview study.	OBJECTIVES: To investigate the experience of South Asian marriage migrant women in Taiwan by (1) determining their experiences and health beliefs during the postnatal period and their uptake of health care and determining the number of women with positive screening scores for postnatal depression during this period. METHODS: South Asian marriage migrant women were recruited using the following criteria: (1) Vietnamese and Indonesian women living in Taiwan for more than 1 year; (2) 6 months post-uncomplicated delivery; (3) conversational ability in Taiwanese and/or Mandarin Chinese and (4) a semi-structured interview and translated versions of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) investigated their experiences and health beliefs and identified the women with positive screens for postnatal depression. RESULTS: A total of 106 migrant women agreed to take part. Ninety-two women were from Vietnam (86.7%) and 14 from Indonesia (13.3%). More than half (56.6%) were aged between 19 and 24 (66% primigravida). The husbands of the women were mainly unskilled workers (80%). The frequency of a positive screen for postnatal depression was 25.5% (EPDS score >13). There was a statistically significant association between a score of 13 or more on the EPDS and self-reported 'emotional distress' following birth (p<0.01 ANOVA). Thematic analysis derived four key themes related to their experience and health beliefs: (1) Self-reported health: Although the main concern of the migrant women was the health of their baby and their families, some of them found their new families were unsupportive when they themselves were unwell. (2) Health beliefs: Dietary beliefs were important with a number of issues arising from a difference in health beliefs between themselves and their new families. (3) Access to health care: Communication problems and difficulties arising from their relationships with their new families affected 1/3 of women's access to health care and available health information. (4) Adaptation to a new environment: Many of the women described how difficult it was to adapt to their new environment and how they coped with the difficulties. CONCLUSIONS: South Asian migrant women in Taiwan face considerable challenges. If the health needs of these women are to be met, interventions which are "culturally competent" at the level of the individual, family and organisation need to be developed.
17418888	Functional connectivity in an fMRI study of semantic and phonological processes and the effect of L-Dopa.	We describe an fMRI experiment examining the functional connectivity (FC) between regions of the brain associated with semantic and phonological processing. We wished to explore whether L-Dopa administration affects the interaction between language network components in semantic and phonological categorization tasks, as revealed by FC. We hypothesized that L-Dopa would decrease FC due to restriction of the semantic network. During two test sessions (placebo and L-Dopa) each participant performed two fMRI runs, involving phonological and semantic processing. A number of brain regions commonly activated by the two tasks were chosen as regions if interest: left inferior frontal, left posterior temporal and left fusiform gyri, and left parietal cortex. FC was calculated and further analyzed for effects of either the drug or task. No main effect for drug was found. A significant main effect for task was found, with a greater average correlation for the phonological task than for the semantic task. These findings suggest that language areas are activated in a more synchronous manner for phonological than for semantic tasks. This may relate to the fact that phonological processes are mediated to a greater extent within language areas, whereas semantic tasks likely require greater interaction outside of the language areas. Alternatively, this may be due to differences in the attentional requirements of the two tasks.
17431759	Advanced stages and poorly differentiated grade are associated with an increased risk of HER2/neu positive breast carcinoma only in White women: findings from a prospective cohort study of African-American and White-American women.	OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the race-specific risk associated with HER2/neu positive breast carcinoma in a prospective cohort design. Our secondary objectives were to assess prevalence of different breast cancer phenotypes between African-American and White women and to determine if race was associated with the risk of basal-like breast carcinoma phenotype in this cohort. METHODS: Demographic, clinical and pathologic data were collected from existing databases. The status of HER2/neu and hormone receptors was dichotomized as either positive or negative. Immunohistochemistry taxonomy was used to assess prevalence of different breast carcinoma phenotypes. Risk estimates were calculated using the multivariable logistic regression statistics. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of HER2/neu positive breast carcinoma differs between African-American and White women. For White women only, this risk was statistically significant and increased almost linearly within each TNM stage with grade dedifferentiation. The statistically significantly higher prevalence of "ER(-)/PR(-), HER2(- )" phenotype in African American women potentially is the attributing factor to observed lack of an association between the risk of HER2/neu positive breast carcinoma with advanced stages and poorly differentiated grade. Among women diagnosed with "ER(-)/PR(-), HER2(-)" phenotype the odds ratios of being African-American and pre-menopausal was 1.72 (95% CI 1.17-2.54, P = 0.006) and 1.94 (95% CI 1.27-2.96, P = 0.002), respectively. The histologic features of basal-like and ER(-)/HER2(+ )carcinomas overlaps. Differences in the biology of breast carcinoma between African American and White women are partially attributed to the disparity in more adverse pathologic prognostic indicators at the initial clinical presentation of this disease.
17433669	Studies on cottonseed oil biodiesel prepared in non-catalytic SCF conditions.	The vegetable oils are all extremely viscous with viscosities ranging from 10 to 20 times greater than petroleum diesel fuel. The purpose of the transesterification process is to lower the viscosity of the oil. Methyl and ethyl esters as biodiesel were prepared from cottonseed oil through transesterification using non-catalytic supercritical fluids. The transesterfication of linseed oil in SCF such as methanol and ethanol has proved to be the most promising process. The biodiesels were characterized for their physical and main fuel properties including viscosity, density, flash point and higher heating value (HHV). The viscosities of biodiesels (3.6-4.0 mm(2)/s at 311 K) were much less than those of pure oils (33-36 mm(2)/s at 311 K), and their HHVs of approximately 40.5 MJ/kg were 10% less than those of petrodiesel fuels (approximately 45 MJ/kg). The flash point values (435-445 K) of methyl and ethyl esters are highly lower than that of cottonseed oil (507-512 K). The most important variables affecting the ester yield during the transesterification reaction are molar ratio of alcohol to vegetable oil and reaction temperature.
17434157	Extending the Bacillus cereus group genomics to putative food-borne pathogens of different toxicity.	The Bacillus cereus group represents sporulating soil bacteria containing pathogenic strains which may cause diarrheic or emetic food poisoning outbreaks. Multiple locus sequence typing revealed a presence in natural samples of these bacteria of about 30 clonal complexes. Application of genomic methods to this group was however biased due to the major interest for representatives closely related to Bacillus anthracis. Albeit the most important food-borne pathogens were not yet defined, existing data indicate that they are scattered all over the phylogenetic tree. The preliminary analysis of the sequences of three genomes discussed in this paper narrows down the gaps in our knowledge of the B. cereus group. The strain NVH391-98 is a rare but particularly severe food-borne pathogen. Sequencing revealed that the strain should be a representative of a novel bacterial species, for which the name Bacillus cytotoxis or Bacillus cytotoxicus is proposed. This strain has a reduced genome size compared to other B. cereus group strains. Genome analysis revealed absence of sigma B factor and the presence of genes encoding diarrheic Nhe toxin, not detected earlier. The strain B. cereus F837/76 represents a clonal complex close to that of B. anthracis. Including F837/76, three such B. cereus strains had been sequenced. Alignment of genomes suggests that B. anthracis is their common ancestor. Since such strains often emerge from clinical cases, they merit a special attention. The third strain, KBAB4, is a typical facultative psychrophile generally found in soil. Phylogenic studies show that in nature it is the most active group in terms of gene exchange. Genomic sequence revealed high presence of extra-chromosomal genetic material (about 530kb) that may account for this phenomenon. Genes coding Nhe-like toxin were found on a big plasmid in this strain. This may indicate a potential mechanism of toxicity spread from the psychrophile strain community. The results of this genomic work and ecological compartments of different strains incite to consider a necessity of creating prophylactic vaccines against bacteria closely related to NVH391-98 and F837/76. Presumably developing of such vaccines can be based on the properties of non-pathogenic strains such as KBAB4 or ATCC14579 reported here or earlier. By comparing the protein coding genes of strains being sequenced in this project to others we estimate the shared proteome, or core genome, in the B. cereus group to be 3000+/-200 genes and the total proteome, or pan-genome, to be 20-25,000 genes.
17434728	Kinetics of sunflower oil methanolysis at low temperatures.	The kinetics of the sunflower oil methanolysis process was studied at lower temperatures (10-30 degrees C). The sigmoidal kinetics of the process was explained by the mass transfer controlled region in the initial heterogenous regime, followed by the chemical reaction controlled region in the pseudo-homogenous regime. A simple kinetic model, which did not require complex computation of the kinetic constants, was used for simulation of the TG conversion and the FAME formation in the latter regime: the fast irreversible second-order reaction was followed by the slow reversible second-order reaction close to the completion of the methanolysis reaction. The mass transfer was related to the drop size of the dispersed (methanol) phase, which reduced rapidly with the progress of the methanolysis reaction. This was attributed to the formation of the emulsifying agents stabilizing the emulsion of methanol drops into the oil.
17434730	Use of industrial wastewater from olive-oil extraction for biomass production of Scenedesmus obliquus.	The use of rinse water (RW) from two-phase centrifugation in the olive-oil extraction industry has been studied in relation to the production of the microalga Scenedesmus obliquus (CCAP 276/3A). The characterization of the wastewater indicates that it is N deficient. The highest value of maximum specific growth rate, 0.044 h(-1) was registered in the culture with 5% RW. However, biomass productivity proved greater in the culture with 100% RW. The specific growth rates were adjusted to a model of inhibition by substrate. The content in normalized chlorophyll diminished with the duration of the cultures, reaching a minimum CHL'(min) value, which showed an inhibition type similar to that of the specific growth rate. The yield in protein indicates that the cultures were limited by N to approximately 50% RW. The greater specific rate of protein synthesis during the exponential phase was 3.7 mg/gh to 50% RW. It was found that the composition of the lipid fraction of the biomass depended on the percentage of wastewater used as the nutrient medium, reaching the highest percentages of monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, and essential fatty acids in the culture with 100% RW.
17434754	Assessment of repeatability of surface electromyography signals by singular value decomposition.	Singular value decomposition (SVD) of full-wave rectified surface electromyography (sEMG) signals was investigated for repeatability indices of sEMG linear envelopes (LE) during biceps curl. The SVD based repeatability indices were compared with a well-known method, the variance ratio (VR). The usefulness of the offered indices was examined by a simulation and it was applied to the sEMG LEs. The results have shown that the VRs were correlated with the SVD based indices significantly. The usefulness of the offered indices on real world EMG signals practically comes from decreasing amplitudes of the first few singular values of EMG LE matrix. If repeatability is high, singular values decay fast and vice versa. If justified by further researches, the offered indices may be used practically for repeatability measurement of sEMG LEs.
17442604	Autofluorescence as a tool to study mucus secretion in Eisenia foetida.	Autofluorescence in living cells is due to the presence of endogenous substances that emit fluorescence upon excitation by incidental light. A type of fluorescence, bioluminescence, has been suggested to be linked to mucus secretion in earthworms; however, the origin and the physiological function of this fluorescence are not clear. The aims of this work were to describe autofluorescence in the earthworm Eisenia foetida by SEM, CLSM, and fluorescence microscopy and to examine the possible mechanism of mucus secretion by video microscopy. Earthworms were stimulated either chemically or electrically to induce the secretion of yellow mucus, which was subsequently studied by video microscopy. Mucus was released from the body wall and near the mouth. This phenomenon was associated with autofluorescence and involved at least four distinct stages: release of vesicles, formation of granules, muscular contraction, and organization of strands. The fluorescent molecules were stored in vesicles bound to the membranes. These vesicles were intact when shed from the body. The vesicles were stable but also changed to a granular material or formed strands. Video analyses demonstrated that secretion was dependent on the type of stimulus.
17443124	Opioid-dependent anticipatory negative contrast and binge-like eating in rats with limited access to highly preferred food.	Binge eating and an increased role for palatability in determining food intake are abnormal adaptations in feeding behavior linked to eating disorders and body weight dysregulation. The present study tested the hypothesis that rats with limited access to highly preferred food would develop analogous opioid-dependent learned adaptations in feeding behavior, with associated changes in metabolism and anxiety-like behavior. For this purpose, adolescent female Wistar rats were daily food deprived (2 h) and then offered 10-min access to a feeder containing chow followed sequentially by 10-min access to a different feeder containing either chow (chow/chow; n=7) or a highly preferred, but macronutrient-comparable, sucrose-rich diet (chow/preferred; n=8). Chow/preferred-fed rats developed binge-like hyperphagia of preferred diet from the second feeder and anticipatory chow hypophagia from the first feeder with a time course suggesting associative learning. The feeding adaptations were dissociable in onset, across individuals, and in their dose-response to the opioid-receptor antagonist nalmefene, suggesting that they represent distinct palatability-motivated processes. Chow/preferred-fed rats showed increased anxiety-like behavior in relation to their propensity to binge as well as increased feed efficiency, body weight, and visceral adiposity. Chow/preferred-fed rats also had increased circulating leptin levels and decreased growth hormone and 'active' ghrelin levels. Thus, the short-term control of food intake in rats with restricted access to highly preferred foods comes to rely more on hedonic, rather than nutritional, properties of food, through associative learning mechanisms. Such rats show changes in ingestive, metabolic, endocrine, and anxiety-related measures, which resemble features of binge eating disorders or obesity.
17453011	Evaluation of an occupational therapy program for patients with spinal cord injury.	STUDY DESIGN: Clinical controlled trial. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of an occupational therapy (OT) program combined with neuromotor rehabilitation, by assessing the degree of functional independence reached by patients with spinal cord injuries at first hospitalization. SETTINGS: Subjects selected from the Spinal Cord Unit of the Rehabilitation Institute of Montecatone (Imola, Italy). PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-six male patients below age 60, with complete paraplegia (ASIA-A) in thoracic-lumbar level, at first hospitalization. METHODS: Patients were divided into experimental and control groups. Subjects in the experimental group underwent neuromotor rehabilitation coupled with an OT program, whereas those in the control group followed neuromotor rehabilitation only. Increase in functional independence at discharge was evaluated by the Valutazione Funzionale Mielolesi (VFM) assessment scale. RESULTS: Patients in the experimental group showed a significant increase in the total VFM score, and in domains concerning transfers and wheelchair use. A significant improvement was observed in unmarried patients as compared to married ones. CONCLUSION: An OT service within a Spinal Cord Unit allows us to achieve a higher level of functional independence.
17457812	STAT3: a critical transcription activator in angiogenesis.	Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from the pre-existing vasculature, is a complex multistage process regulated by a number of signal transduction pathways. Accumulating evidence suggests that signal transducer and activator of transcription (STATs), mainly STAT3, play an important role in angiogenesis under both physiological and pathological conditions in addition to cell survival, proliferation, differentiation, and oncogenesis. STAT3, as a critical multifunctional mediator, regulates many aspects of angiogenesis at the transcriptional level. This review will highlight the pivotal role of STAT3 in well-studied tumorous angiogenesis and cardiac angiogenesis, and summarize various potential mechanisms utilized by STAT3 to regulate the transcriptional activation of VEGF.
17459123	Meiotic segregation analysis in male translocation carriers by using fluorescent in situ hybridization.	Balanced reciprocal and Robertsonian translocations are the most common structural chromosome abnormalities in humans, with incidences of 0.7 and 1.23 per 1000. These translocations can affect fertility and/or pregnancy outcome because of possibly impaired production of gametes with an unbalanced zygote caused by the parental arrangement. Fertility problems in male translocation carriers are because of various degrees of sperm alterations that are directly related to the disturbance of the meiotic process. Investigation of human sperm chromosomes was performed by karyotyping spermatozoa after penetration of zona-free hamster oocytes, karyotype analysis now being possible to analyse the segregation patterns by using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Here, we document the results of meiotic segregation analysis for four Robertsonian and four reciprocal translocation carriers by FISH. In the sperm of Robertsonian translocation males, the majority of spermatozoa were normal/balanced. On the other hand, males with reciprocal translocations demonstrated a high rate of unbalanced spermatozoa of about 50% on meiotic segregation, with an unusually high rate (23.5%) of 3 : 1 segregation. This knowledge can be used for genetic counselling of families with these types of translocations.
17468023	Prevalence of Taenia solium porcine cysticercosis in the Eastern, Southern and Western provinces of Zambia.	Tongue examination and detection of circulating antigen (Ag-ELISA) were used to establish the prevalence of Taenia solium porcine cysticercosis in free-range pigs in selected districts of Eastern, Southern and Western provinces of Zambia, and to determine if prevalence of porcine cysticercosis was associated with age, breed and sex. Households with pigs were identified using the snowballing technique. A total of 1691 pigs were examined out of which 183 (10.8%) were positive on tongue examination. Ag-ELISA gave a sero-prevalence of 23.3%. When considering the factors in a logistic regression analysis, only breed type was significantly associated with porcine cysticercosis (OR=0.72; 95%CI=0.63-0.81). The crossbred pigs were 72% more likely to have had cysticercosis than the Nsenga (dwarf local) breed as determined by Ag-ELISA. The result that crossbred pigs had a higher prevalence of T. solium cysticercosis suggests that pig breeds may display different susceptibility to cysticercosis. The limited use of latrines in these areas implies that people use the nearby bush for defecation, resulting in pigs having access to human faeces. Therefore, investigation of taeniosis and cysticercosis in humans is warranted to better comprehend the local epidemiology and transmission risks. This should then be followed by extension programs to communities so that the control plans that could be instituted are more sustainable.
17481639	Azelnidipine has anti-atherosclerotic effects independent of its blood pressure-lowering actions in monkeys and mice.	Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) have been shown to improve clinical outcomes in atherosclerotic vascular disease. The mechanisms underlying the vasculoprotective effects of a third-generation calcium channel blocker, azelnidipine, are incompletely understood. We asked whether azelnidipine attenuates atherosclerosis in monkeys and mice beyond its blood pressure-lowering effects. Cynomolgus monkeys were randomized to three groups after 4 weeks of a high cholesterol diet: control group (no treatment) and 3 and 10mg/kg daily azelnidipine; these doses have no effect on systemic arterial pressure or heart rate. Atherosclerosis was induced in the aorta by balloon injury, and the diet and treatment were continued for an additional 24 weeks. Azelnidipine did not affect blood lipid profiles, but reduced the development of atherosclerosis as detected by the elimination of local oxidative stress and reduced expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and platelet-derived growth factor. Azelnidipine also reduced the proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells in vitro. In atherosclerotic ApoE-knockout (ApoE-KO) mice fed a high cholesterol diet, azelnidipine but not amlodipine reduced the development of atherosclerosis. Neither drug changed the lipid profiles or systolic blood pressure of the mice. Thus, azelnidipine at clinically relevant doses exhibited anti-atherosclerotic effects in monkeys and mice independent of its blood pressure-lowering effects, suggesting that azelnidipine might be as a "vasculoprotective calcium channel blocker".
17481788	28-homobrassinolide protects chickpea (Cicer arietinum) from cadmium toxicity by stimulating antioxidants.	In the present experiment the seeds of Cicer arietinum (L.) cv. Uday were inoculated with specific Rhizobium grown in sandy loam soil and were allowed to grow for 15 days. At this stage, the seedlings were supplied with 0, 50, 100 or 150 microM of cadmium in the form of cadmium chloride and sprayed with 0.01 microM of 28-homobrassinolide (HBL) at 30-day stage. The data indicated that plant fresh and dry mass, number of nodules, their fresh and dry mass, leghemoglobin content, nitrogen and carbohydrate content in the nodules, leaf chlorophyll content, nitrate reductase and carbonic anhydrase activities decreased proportionately with the increasing concentrations of cadmium but the content of proline and the activities of catalase, peroxidase and superoxide dismutase increased. The ill effect, generated by cadmium, was overcome if the stressed plants were sprayed with HBL.
17486106	Systemic interferon-alpha regulates interferon-stimulated genes in the central nervous system.	The prime anti-viral cytokine interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) has been implicated in several central nervous system (CNS) disorders in addition to its beneficial effects. Systemic IFN-alpha treatment causes severe neuropsychiatric complications in humans, including depression, anxiety and cognitive impairments. While numerous neuromodulatory effects by IFN-alpha have been described, it remains unresolved whether or not systemic IFN-alpha acts directly on the brain to execute its CNS actions. In the present study, we have analyzed the genes directly regulated in post-IFN-alpha receptor signaling and found that intraperitoneal administration of mouse IFN-alpha, but not human IFN-alpha, activated expression of several prototypic IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), in particular signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT1), IFN-induced 15 kDa protein (ISG15), ubiquitin-specific proteinase 18 (USP18) and guanylate-binding protein 3 (GBP3) in the brain. A similar temporal profile for the regulated expression of these IFN-alpha-activated ISG genes was observed in the brain compared with the peripheral organs. Dual labeling in situ hybridization combined with immunocytochemical staining demonstrated a wide distribution of the key IFN-regulated gene STAT1 transcripts in the different parenchyma cells of the brain, particularly neurons. The overall response to IFN-alpha challenge was abolished in STAT1 knockout mice. Together, our results indicate a direct, STAT1-dependent action of systemic IFN-alpha in the CNS, which may provide the basis for a mechanism in humans for neurological/neuropsychiatric illnesses associated with IFN-alpha therapy.
17487506	Waist circumference percentiles for 7- to 17-year-old Turkish children and adolescents.	Abdominal obesity is associated with risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Waist circumference as a measure of obesity may be clinically useful as a predictor of metabolic syndrome in children. To develop age- and sex-specific reference values for waist circumference we evaluated the data obtained from Turkish children and adolescents. Waist circumference measurements from 4,770 healthy schoolchildren were obtained. Smoothed percentile curves were produced by the LMS method. The median curves of Turkish children were compared with four other countries: Australia, the UK, USA (Bogalusa) and Japan. Smoothed percentile curves and values for the 3rd, 5th, 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 85th, 90th, 95th and 97th percentiles were calculated for boys and girls. We found that waist circumference increased with age both in boys and girls. The 50th percentile waist circumference curve of Turkish children was over the British and Japanese but lower than the Bogalusa children and adolescents. This study presents data and smoothed percentile curves for waist circumference of healthy Turkish children aged 7-17 years. The differences in waist circumference of different countries can be explained by lifestyles and cultural characteristics. These data can be added to the existing international reference values for waist circumference of children and adolescents.
17490462	Effect of habitual exercise on the structural and mechanical properties of human tendon, in vivo, in men and women.	We examined whether long-term habitual training (a) was associated with differences in structural and mechanical properties in tendon in women and (b) yielded different tendon properties in men and women. Ten male runners, 10 female runners and 10 female non-runners were tested. Tendon cross-sectional area (CSA) and length of the patellar and Achilles tendon were determined with MRI. Ultrasonography-based measurement of tendon elongation and force during isometric contractions provided mechanical properties. Distal patellar and Achilles tendon CSAs were greater than the proximal part in all three groups (P<0.05). Weight-normalized Achilles tendon CSA were similar in trained (2.78+/-0.17 mm(2)/kg(3/4)) and untrained women (2.60+/-0.13 mm(2)/kg(3/4)), while that in trained men (3.77+/-0.27 mm(2)/kg(3/4)) was greater compared with trained women (P<0.01). Patellar tendon CSA were comparable in trained and untrained women, while that in trained men was greater compared with trained women (P<0.01). Patellar tendon stiffness was greater in male runners (3528+/-773 N/mm) compared with female runners (2069+/-666 N/mm) and non-runners (2477+/-381 N/mm), (P<0.01), but patellar tendon deformation, stress, strain and modulus were similar. These data indirectly suggest that the ability of Achilles and patellar tendons to adapt in response to habitual loading such as running is attenuated in women.
17490782	Intron splicing in 5' untranslated region of the rolA transcript in transgenic apple.	The rolA gene encoded on the Ri plasmid of Agrobacterium rhizogenes causes developmental alterations, including dwarfing characteristics in the transgenic plants. In an attempt to introduce dwarfing characteristics into apple rootstocks for breeding purposes, the rolA gene was incorporated into the apple rootstock M26 and obtained four transgenic clones. All the clones exhibited reduced growth compared to untransformed control plants but different degree of dwarfing and wrinkled leaves. In the present study, expression of the rolA gene was further investigated by analysing the structure of the rolA transcript and the levels of the rolA mRNAs from these clones. The nucleotide (nt) sequence of the rolA transcript showed two forms of the transcript: one, the unspliced form, was co-linear with the rolA sequence in the genomic DNA; the other was spliced mRNA in which an 85-base pair (bp) intron sequence in the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) was spliced out. The position of splicing is different from that in Arabidopsis thaliana but similar to the splicing site found in tobacco. The transcription start region of the rolA gene in apple was 206bp upstream of that in Arabidopsis and 277bp upstream to Nicotiana tabacum transcription start. A hairpin-like secondary structure and an upstream open reading frame (uORF) were revealed in the rolA 5'UTR. The levels of the rolA mRNA in the apple transgenic clones were analysed by semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The results showed slight variation in the shoot tissues of the transgenic clones.
17498902	The value of diffusion-weighted imaging in combination with T2-weighted imaging for rectal cancer detection.	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical value of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in combination with T(2)-weighted imaging (T(2)WI) for the detection of rectal cancer as compared with T(2)WI alone. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-five patients with rectal cancer and 20 without rectal cancer underwent DWI with parallel imaging and T(2)WI on a 1.5 T scanner. Images were independently reviewed by two readers blinded to the results to determine the detectability of rectal cancer. The detectability of T(2)W imaging without and with DW imaging was assessed by means of receiver operating characteristic analysis. The interobserver agreement between the two readers was calculated with kappa statistics. RESULTS: The ROC analysis showed that each of two readers achieved more accurate results with T(2)W imaging combined with DW imaging than with T(2)W imaging alone significantly. The A(z) values for the two readers for each T(2)WI and T(2)WI combined with DWI were 0.918 versus 0.991 (p=0.0494), 0.934 versus 0.997 (p=0.0475), respectively. The values of kappa were 0.934 for T(2)WI and 0.948 for T(2)WI combined with DWI between the two readers. CONCLUSION: The addition of DW imaging to conventional T(2)W imaging provides better detection of rectal cancer.
17499026	Constructing the gene regulation-level representation of microarray data for cancer classification.	In this paper, we propose a regulation-level representation for microarray data and optimize it using genetic algorithms (GAs) for cancer classification. Compared with the traditional expression-level features, this representation can greatly reduce the dimensionality of microarray data and accommodate noise and variability such that many statistical machine-learning methods now become applicable and efficient for cancer classification. Experimental results on real-world microarray datasets show that the regulation-level representation can consistently converge at a solution with three regulation levels. This verifies the existence of the three regulation levels (up-regulation, down-regulation and non-significant regulation) associated with a particular biological phenotype. The ternary regulation-level representation not only improves the cancer classification capability but also facilitates the visualization of microarray data.
17499204	Visual processing and the bodily self.	The 'body schema' has traditionally been defined as a passively updated, proprioceptive representation of the body. However, recent work has suggested that body representations are more complex and flexible than previously thought. They may integrate current perceptual information from all sensory modalities, and can be extended to incorporate indirect representations of the body and functional portions of tools. In the present study, we investigate the source of a facilitatory effect of viewing the body on speeded visual discrimination reaction times. Participants responded to identical visual stimuli that varied only in their context: being presented on the participant's own body, on the experimenter's body, or in a neutral context. The stimuli were filmed and viewed in real-time on a projector screen. Careful controls for attention, biological saliency, and attribution confirmed that the facilitatory effect depends critically on participants attributing the context to a real body. An intermediate effect was observed when the stimuli were presented on another person's body, suggesting that the effect of viewing one's own body might represent a conjunction of an interpersonal body effect and an egocentric effect.
17509681	dup(1)(q21q32) as a sole cytogenetic event is associated to a leukemic transformation in myelodysplastic syndromes.	Duplication of the long arm of chromosome 1 (1q) has been detected accompanied with other chromosome abnormalities in Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS). However, as a sole karyotypic change, it is rarely observed. We present here two patients affected of a MDS that showed a dup(1)(q21q32) as a sole cytogenetic change in their bone marrow cells. Complementary methodologies confirmed the duplication of chromosome 1q and, did not show additional cryptic chromosome abnormalities. One patient acquired a secondary trisomy 8 and the other one progressed toward an acute leukemia with no additional cytogenetic alterations.
17512645	Women's lived experience of fear of childbirth.	OBJECTIVE: to describe women's lived experience of fear of childbirth. DESIGN: a qualitative study using a phenomenological approach and a lifeworld perspective. Data were collected via tape-recorded interviews. SETTING: Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Göteborg, Sweden in 2003. PARTICIPANTS: eight pregnant women (24-37 gestational weeks) seeking help within an outpatient clinic for women with severe fear of childbirth. Two of the women were primiparous. FINDINGS: four constituents were identified: feeling of danger that threatens and appeals; feeling trapped; feeling like an inferior mother-to-be and on your own. The essential structure was described as 'to lose oneself as a woman into loneliness'. KEY CONCLUSIONS: fear of childbirth affects women in such a way that they start to doubt themselves and feel uncertain of their ability to bear and give birth to a child. Previous birth experience was central to the multiparous women. They described their experiences of suffering in relation to the care they received during childbirth. This mainly concerned pain and negative experiences with staff. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: pregnant women who fear childbirth are an exposed group in need of much support during pregnancy and childbirth. The encounter between the woman and the midwife can be a way of breaking down the feeling of loneliness and restoring the woman's trust in herself as a childbearing woman.
17517482	A complex intersex condition in a Holstein calf.	A case of disrupted embryonic development of the genital tract in a newborn Holstein calf is described. The physical examination of the calf evidenced several abnormalities, like atresia ani, rudimentary external genitalia and caudal vertebral agenesis. On necropsy, the excised genitalia consisted of bilateral streak gonads, apparently normal uterine tubes, a fluid-filled uterus, a long vagina and a very narrow clitoris-like structure covered with a discrete skin-fold. The urinary tract seemed normal and the urethra's opening was at the vestibule-vaginal junction. A cytogenetic analysis was requested. Karyotype revealed the existence of Y chromosome material in the two X chromosomes. However, the search for the sex-determining region Y (SRY) showed that this was an apparently absent gene. The histological examination of the gonads revealed the existence of ovarian dysplasia. Uterine sections evidenced the absence of the uterine epithelium, with only sporadic caruncles. Under microscopic examination, the uterine tubes and vagina structure was normal. The external genitalia sections revealed the existence of a skin-fold covering an erectile structure surrounding the urethra, a structure more similar to a penis than to a clitoris. This is an unusual situation of gonadal dysplasia combined with genital tract anomalies in cattle, probably associated to a genetic defect.
17519967	Ecological genomics in Daphnia: stress responses and environmental sex determination.	Ecological genomics is the study of adaptation of natural populations to their environment, and therefore seeks to link organism and population level processes through an understanding of genome organization and function. The planktonic microcrustacean Daphnia, which has long been an important system for ecology, is now being used as a genomic model as well. Here we review recent progress in selected areas of Daphnia genomics research. Production of parthenogenetic male offspring occurs through environmental cues, which clearly involves endocrine regulation and has also been studied as a toxicological response to juvenoid hormone analog insecticides. Recent progress has uncovered a putative juvenoid cis-response element, which together with microarray analysis will stimulate further research into nuclear hormone receptors and their associated transcriptional regulatory networks. Ecotoxicological studies indicate that mRNA profiling is a sensitive and specific research tool with promising applications in environmental monitoring and for uncovering conserved cellular processes. Rapid progress is expected to continue in these and other areas, as genomic tools for Daphnia become widely available to investigators.
17520342	Molecular characterization and expression analysis of OsBISERK1, a gene encoding a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase, during disease resistance responses in rice.	A rice gene, OsBISERK1, encoding a protein belonging to SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR KINASE (SERK) type of leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLKs) was identified. The OsBISERK1 encodes a 624 aa protein with high level of identity to known plant SERKs. OsBISERK1 contains a hydrophobic signal peptide, a leucine zipper, and five leucine-rich repeat motifs in the extracellular domain; the cytoplasmic region carries a proline-rich region and a single transmembrane domain, as well as a conserved intracellular serine/threonine protein kinase domain. OsBISERK1 has a low level of basal expression in leaf tissue. However, expression of OsBISERK1 was induced by treatment with benzothiadiazole (BTH), which is capable of inducing disease resistance in rice, and also up-regulated after inoculation with Magnaporthe grisea in BTH-treated rice seedlings and during incompatible interaction between a blast-resistant rice genotype and M. grisea. The results suggest that OsBISERK1 may be involved in disease resistance responses in rice.
17521726	Evaluation of colostral immunity in swine with commercial anti-leptospira polyvalent whole-bacteria vaccine.	The intensity and duration of passive immunity against swine leptospirosis were investigated by the microscopic agglutination test and in vitro leptospira growth inhibition. Twenty-one females at first parturition were divided into three groups: Group A (n=08): received two doses with 30 days interval of the commercial anti-leptospira bacterin A. Group B (n=06) received two doses with 30 days interval of the commercial anti-leptospira bacterin B and Group C (n=07) was the control. In all groups the colostrums were collected. Blood collection of piglets was performed in four different ages. Agglutinin antibodies were equally detected in sera and colostrums for serovars Canicola, Grippotyphosa, Copenhageni, Icterohaemorrhagiae and Pomona (Group A) and Canicola, Copenhageni, Icterohaemorrhagiae, Pomona and Hardjo (Group B). Mean neutralizing antibodies titers were low. Passive immunity was low duration.
17526485	Natural radioactivity measurements in rock samples of Cuihua Mountain National Geological Park, China.	The concentrations of the natural radionuclides namely 40K, 232Th and 226Ra in rock samples collected from Cuihua Mountain National Geological Park of China have been determined using a NaI(Tl) detector. The concentrations of 226Ra, 232Th and 40K in the studied rock samples range from 10.7 to 34.8, 19.9 to 53.6 and 642.7 to 1609.9 Bq kg(-1) with an average of 20.4, 30.1 and 1009.5 Bq kg(-1), respectively. The concentrations of these radionuclides are compared with the typical world values. To evaluate the radiological hazard of the natural radioactivity, the radium equivalent activity, the air absorbed dose rate, the annual effective dose rate, the representative level index and the values of both external and internal hazard indices were evaluated and compared with the internationally approved values. The radium equivalent activity values of all rock samples are lower than the limit of 370 Bq kg(-1). The values of H ex and H in are less than unity. The mean outdoor air absorbed dose rate is 69.7 nGy h(-1), and the corresponding outdoor effective dose rate is 0.086 mSv y(-1).
17530428	Effects of a combined aerobic and resistance exercise program in breast cancer survivors: a randomized controlled trial.	Few randomized controlled trials have examined the effects of combined aerobic and resistance training in breast cancer survivors soon after completing adjuvant therapy. Breast cancer survivors (N=58) within 2 years of completing adjuvant therapy were randomly assigned to an immediate exercise group (IEG; n=29) or a delayed exercise group (DEG; n=29). The IEG completed 12 weeks of supervised aerobic and resistance exercise, three times per week. The DEG completed the program during the next 12 weeks. Participants completed patient-rated outcomes at baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was overall quality of life (QoL) measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast scale. Secondary endpoints were fatigue, social physique anxiety, and physical fitness. Follow-up data was obtained on 97% of participants and exercise adherence was 61.3%. Repeated measures analyses of variance revealed a significant group by time interaction for overall QoL (P<0.001). Specifically, QoL increased in the IEG from baseline to 12 weeks by 20.8 points compared to a decrease in the DEG of 5.3 points (mean group difference=26.1; 95% CI=18.3-32.7; P<0.001). From 12 to 24 weeks, QoL increased in the DEG by 29.5 points compared to an increase of 6.5 points in the IEG (mean group difference=23.0; 95% CI=16.3-29.1; P<0.001). Similar results were obtained for the secondary endpoints. Combined aerobic and resistance exercise soon after the completion of breast cancer therapy produces large and rapid improvements in health-related outcomes.
17531473	Biodiesel production from crude Jatropha curcas L. seed oil with a high content of free fatty acids.	A technique to produce biodiesel from crude Jatropha curcas seed oil (CJCO) having high free fatty acids (15%FFA) has been developed. The high FFA level of JCJO was reduced to less than 1% by a two-step pretreatment process. The first step was carried out with 0.60 w/w methanol-to-oil ratio in the presence of 1% w/w H(2)SO(4) as an acid catalyst in 1-h reaction at 50 degrees C. After the reaction, the mixture was allowed to settle for 2h and the methanol-water mixture separated at the top layer was removed. The second step was transesterified using 0.24 w/w methanol to oil and 1.4% w/w NaOH to oil as alkaline catalyst to produce biodiesel at 65 degrees C. The final yield for methyl esters of fatty acids was achieved ca. 90% in 2 h.
17531989	Ovarian response and pregnancy outcome in poor-responder women: a randomized controlled trial on the effect of luteinizing hormone supplementation on in vitro fertilization cycles.	OBJECTIVE: To prospectively assess the effect of using a combination of recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone (rFSH) and recombinant luteinizing hormone (rLH) on ovarian stimulation parameters and treatment outcome among poor-responder patients. DESIGN: Prospective randomized trial. SETTING: University-associated private medical center. PATIENT(S): Eighty-four patients who had a basal FSH level of >or=10 mIU/mL, who were >or=40 years of age, and who were undergoing their first IVF cycle participated in this controlled trial. INTERVENTION(S): Patients were randomly allocated into two study groups: group A, in which ovarian stimulation included GnRH analogue and rFSH and rLH, and group B, in which patients received GnRH analogue and rFSH without further LH addition. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Primary outcome measures included the ongoing pregnancy rate per retrieval and implantation rate per embryo transferred. The number of days of gonadotropin treatment, E(2) level on rHCG administration day, number of developed follicles, number of retrieved oocytes, number of normally fertilized zygotes (at the two-pronuclear [2PN] stage), cumulative embryo score, and number of transferred embryos were also evaluated. RESULT(S): The overall pregnancy rate was 22.61% (19 pregnancies among 84 couples). The pregnancy wastage rate was 30.00% in group A and 22.22% in group B. There were no differences in either primary or secondary end points. CONCLUSION(S): The results of this prospective and randomized trial show that the addition of rLH at a given time of follicular development produces no further benefit in the patient population of our study. A reduced ovarian response cannot be overcome by changes in the stimulation protocol.
17535472	Synaesthesia, creativity and art: what is the link?	It has been suggested that individuals with synaesthesia may show heightened creativity as a result of being able to form meaningful associations between disparate stimuli (e.g. colour, sound). In this study, a large sample (N=82) of people with various kinds of synaesthesia were given two psychometric tests of creativity (Remote Associates Test, Alternate Uses Test) and were also asked about the amount of time engaged in creative arts (visual art, music). There was a significant tendency for synaesthetes to spend more time engaged in creative arts and this was, at least in part, dependent upon the type of synaesthesia experienced. For example, synaesthetes experiencing vision from music were far more likely to play an instrument than their other synaesthetic counterparts. There was no relationship between this tendency and the psychometric measures of creativity, but synaesthetes did outperform controls on one of the two psychometric measures (Remote Associates). We conclude that the tendency for synaesthetes to be more engaged in art is likely to have a different mechanism to psychometric measures of creativity, and that there is no direct link between them. Although synaesthetes may well perform better on some measures of creativity, we suggest that synaesthetes have better bottom-up access to certain associations, but are not necessarily better able to use them flexibly (in divergent thinking).
17537278	Studying health-seeking behaviours: collecting reliable data, conducting comprehensive analysis.	There is certainly a growing need to justify the significance of studying health-seeking behaviours for designing advocacy campaigns, lobbying for a policy shift and convincing donors to invest in priority areas. Moreover, policymakers need to be encouraged to design evidence-based policies that take into account information relating to health-promoting, -seeking and -utilization behaviour and the factors determining these behaviours. This paper primarily covers the 'methodology' used in the study of health-seeking behaviours and determinants of health services utilization in a predominantly rural district of Pakistan. The paper substantiates that this methodology is comprehensive and reliable, and there is potential for replicating this in similar settings. The approach of Kroeger in his research on the study of health-seeking behaviours, particularly in developing countries, provides the most holistic framework for examining, analysing and interpreting factors and determinants of health-seeking behaviours and health services utilization in developing countries. This study endeavoured to validate Kroeger's framework in a Pakistani setting, exploring all the factors listed through mixed method research, and qualitative supplemented by representative quantitative enquiry. This approach has also helped in understanding the inter-relationship of various factors and drivers of health-seeking behaviours from all angles.
17537511	Cobalt and nickel uptake by rice and accumulation in soil amended with municipal solid waste compost.	Effect of addition of municipal solid waste compost (MSWC) on cobalt (Co) and nickel (Ni) contents of submerged rice paddies were studied. A sequential extraction method was used to determine the metal (Co and Ni) fractions in MSWC and cow dung manure (CDM). Both metals were significantly bound to the organic matter and Fe and Mn oxides in MSWC and CDM. Metal content in rice straw was higher than in rice grain. Metal bound with Fe and Mn oxides in MSWC and CDM best correlated with straw and grain metal followed by water soluble and exchangeable fractions. Carbonate, organic matter bound and residual fractions in MSWC and CDM did not significantly correlate with rice straw and grain metal. MSWC would be a valuable resource for agriculture, but long-term field experiments with MSWC are needed to assess by regular monitoring of the metal loads and accumulation in soil and plants.
17537584	Cannabis use and suicidal behaviours in high-school students.	The aim of the study was to evaluate the relative contributions of cannabis use, depressive and anxious symptoms in the prediction of suicidal behaviors. Participants were 248 high-school students who completed questionnaires assessing cannabis use, suicidal behaviors, depressive and anxious symptoms. Cannabis use was a significant independent predictor of suicidal behaviors after adjustment for depressive and anxious symptoms.
17541740	Quantitative analysis of mitochondrial DNA 4977-bp deletion in sporadic breast cancer and benign breast diseases.	The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) 4977-bp deletion (DeltamtDNA(4977) mutation) is one of the most frequently observed mtDNA mutations in human tissues and may play a role in carcinogenesis. Only a few studies have evaluated DeltamtDNA(4977) mutation in breast cancer tissue, and the findings have been inconsistent, which may be due to methodological differences. In this study, we developed a quantitative real-time PCR assay to assess the level of the DeltamtDNA(4977) mutation in tumor tissue samples from 55 primary breast cancer patients and 21 patients with benign breast disease (BBD). The DeltamtDNA(4977) mutation was detected in all of the samples with levels varying from 0.000149% to 7.0%. The DeltamtDNA(4977) mutation levels were lower in tumor tissues than in adjacent normal tissues in both breast cancer and BBD subjects. The differences, however, were not statistically significant. No significant difference between breast cancer and BBD patients was found in the DeltamtDNA(4977) mutation levels of tumor tissues and adjacent normal tissues. The DeltamtDNA(4977) mutation levels were not significantly associated with clinicopathological characteristics (age, histology, tumor stage, and ER/PR status) in breast cancer or BBD patients. These results do not support the notion that the mitochondrial DNA 4977-bp deletion plays a major role in breast carcinogenesis.
17541742	Germline TP53 mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative French Canadian breast cancer families.	About 40% of French Canadian breast and/or ovarian cancer families harbor germline BRCA1 or BRCA1 mutations where common mutations account for about 84% of all mutations identified in cancer families. Within a series of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative families, a germline TP53 13398 G>A (Arg213Gln) mutation was identified, which was selected for mutation analysis in this gene because of a family history consistent with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). Given the founder effects in this population, the 13398 G>A mutation was screened in series of 52 BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative cancer families, and a mutation-positive family was identified. However, pedigree inspection and expansion of mutation-positive families with the same mutation revealed that they were closely related to each other. To further characterize the contribution of TP53 in cancer families, mutation analysis was performed in the remaining BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative cancer families. Thirty sequence variants were identified, the majority of which occur in intronic sequences and are not predicted to affect the functionality of TP53. However, the 14538 G>A (Arg290His) mutation was identified in a family which did not exhibit features consistent with LFS or Li-Fraumeni-like (LFL) syndrome. Neither of the TP53 mutations was detected in 381 French Canadian women with breast cancer diagnosed before 50 years of age not selected for family history of cancer. In all, germline TP53 mutations were identified in two of 52 (3.8%) cancer families, suggesting that TP53 is not a major contributor to BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative breast and/or ovarian cancer families of French Canadian descent.
17541946	Angiogenesis by transplantation of HIF-1 alpha modified EPCs into ischemic limbs.	Hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) is a key determinant of oxygen-dependent gene regulation in angiogenesis. HIF-1 alpha overexpression may be beneficial in cell therapy of hypoxia-induced pathophysiological processes, such as ischemic heart disease. To address this issue, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) were induced to differentiate into endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), and then were transfected with either an HIF-1 alpha-expressing or a control vector and cultured under normoxia or hypoxia. Hypoxia-induced HIF-1 alpha mRNA and protein expression was increased after HIF-1 alpha transfection. This was accompanied by VEGF mRNA induction and increased VEGF secretion. Hypoxia-stimulated VEGF mRNA induction was significantly abrogated by HIF-1 alpha-specific siRNA. Functional studies showed that HIF-1 alpha overexpression further promoted hypoxia-induced EPC differentiation, proliferation and migration. The expressions of endothelial cell markers CD31, VEGFR2 (Flk-1) and eNOS as well as VEGF and NO secretions were also increased. Furthermore, in an in vivo model of hindlimb ischemia, HIF-1 alpha-transfected EPCs homed to the site of ischemia. A higher revascularization potential was also demonstrated by increased capillary density at the injury site. Our results revealed that endothelial progenitor cells ex vivo modification by hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha gene transfection is feasible and may offer significant advantages in terms of EPC expansion and treatment efficacy.
17542042	Characterization of brain metastases using high-resolution magic angle spinning MRS.	The objectives of this study were to (a) explore the spectral characteristics of brain metastases, focusing on the origin of the primary cancer, and (b) evaluate the correlation with clinical outcome using multivariate analysis. High-resolution magic angle spinning (HR-MAS) MR spectra (n = 26) were obtained from 16 patients with brain metastases using a Bruker Avance DRX600 instrument. Standard pulse-acquired and spin-echo (TE 32 and 285 ms) (1)H spectra were obtained. These were examined using principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares regression analysis (PLS) relating spectral data to clinical outcome. The PCA score plot of pulse-acquired HR-MAS spectra showed a trend of clustering due to the origin of the metastases, mainly based on differences in the lipid signals at 1.3 and 0.9 ppm. With PLS, spectra of patients who died less than 5 months after surgery appeared to cluster in the lower left quadrant of the score plot. These preliminary results on brain metastasis classification and prediction of survival must be validated in a larger patient cohort. However, the possibility of differentiating metastases according to origin and predicting survival on the basis of HR-MAS spectra suggests that this method may be useful for diagnosing and planning treatment for brain metastases and also for guiding decisions about terminating further treatment.
17543928	Phytoextraction and phytoexcretion of Cd by the leaves of Tamarix smyrnensis growing on contaminated non-saline and saline soils.	Phytoremediation and more specifically phytoextraction, is an alternative restoration strategy for the clean up of heavy metal contaminated soils. Phytoextraction can only be successful if suitable plant species colonize the contaminated area, extract the toxic substances and accumulate them in their above ground tissues. In this study, the salt cedar Tamarix smyrnensis that is a widespread salt-tolerant plant in the Mediterranean region has been investigated. A pot experiment is conducted with T. smyrnensis grown in polluted soil with 16ppm of cadmium and at three different salt concentrations (0.0, 0.5, 3.0% NaCl) for a 10-week period. It took place in an open-air area with natural light, at ambient temperature and humidity in an effort to keep the plants under conditions as similar as possible to those in the field. However, care was taken not to let them be rained on. Temperature ranged from 19 to 50 degrees C with 33 and 21 degrees C being the average day and night temperature, respectively. Humidity ranged from 28% to 87% with a 13-14h photoperiod. The specific aims of this work are to investigate the accumulation of cadmium via root uptake at different saline conditions and cadmium excretion through salt glands on the surface of the leaves as a probable detoxification mechanism of the plant. Furthermore, measurements of chlorophyll content, biomass, and shoot length are used to evaluate the potential of the plant for the removal of cadmium from contaminated saline and non-saline soils. The experimental data suggest that increased soil salinity results in an increase of the cadmium uptake by T. smyrnensis. Analysis of white salt crystals taken from glandular tissue confirmed the fact that this plant excretes cadmium through its salt glands on the surface of the leaves as a possible detoxification mechanism in order to resist metal toxicity. Excreted cadmium is again released into the environment and it is redeposited on the top soil. Furthermore, increased salinity results in an increased excretion of the metal on Tamarix leaf surface. The presence of metals usually affects negatively the plant health, but T. smyrnensis developed no visible signs of metal toxicity, only salt toxicity symptoms were observed. Cadmium usually decreases the chlorophyll content in plants; however, the amount of photosynthetic pigments of T. smyrnensis was found not to be affected. All the above points to the potential of T. smyrnensis for use in phytoremediation with the metal secretion from the leaves being a unique advantage that may change current phytoextraction practices.
17544212	Mindfulness meditation for the treatment of chronic low back pain in older adults: a randomized controlled pilot study.	The objectives of this pilot study were to assess the feasibility of recruitment and adherence to an eight-session mindfulness meditation program for community-dwelling older adults with chronic low back pain (CLBP) and to develop initial estimates of treatment effects. It was designed as a randomized, controlled clinical trial. Participants were 37 community-dwelling older adults aged 65 years and older with CLBP of moderate intensity occurring daily or almost every day. Participants were randomized to an 8-week mindfulness-based meditation program or to a wait-list control group. Baseline, 8-week and 3-month follow-up measures of pain, physical function, and quality of life were assessed. Eighty-nine older adults were screened and 37 found to be eligible and randomized within a 6-month period. The mean age of the sample was 74.9 years, 21/37 (57%) of participants were female and 33/37 (89%) were white. At the end of the intervention 30/37 (81%) participants completed 8-week assessments. Average class attendance of the intervention arm was 6.7 out of 8. They meditated an average of 4.3 days a week and the average minutes per day was 31.6. Compared to the control group, the intervention group displayed significant improvement in the Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire Total Score and Activities Engagement subscale (P=.008, P=.004) and SF-36 Physical Function (P=.03). An 8-week mindfulness-based meditation program is feasible for older adults with CLBP. The program may lead to improvement in pain acceptance and physical function.
17550987	Evolution of different MRI measures in patients with active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis over 2 and 5 years: a case-control study.	BACKGROUND: There is growing evidence for the concept of multiple sclerosis (MS) as an inflammatory neurodegenerative disease, with a different pattern of atrophy evolution in grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM) tissue compartments. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the evolution of different MRI measures in early relapsing-remitting patients with MS and in normal controls (NCs) over 2 years. We also evaluated the progression of these MRI measures in a subset of patients who were followed for up to 5 years. METHODS: Included in this study were 147 patients who participated in the combination ASA (Avonex Steroids Azathioprine) study and completed full treatment, clinical and MRI assessment at 0, 12 and 24 months. A subgroup of 66 patients was followed for 36 months, 51 patients for 48 months and 43 patients for 60 months. Mean age at baseline was 30.7 years, mean disease duration was 5.5 years, mean EDSS was 1.8 and mean annualised relapse rate before study entry was 1.7. MRI scans were performed on a 1.5T scanner every 2 months for the first 2 years and thereafter once yearly for up to 5 years. In addition to the MS group, 27 NCs were examined at months 0, 12 and 24 using the same MRI protocol. Percentage brain volume change (PBVC), GM volume (GMV), WM volume (WMV) and peripheral grey volume (PGV) were measured annually using SIENA/X software. T2-hyperintense lesion volume (LV), lateral ventricle volume (LVV) and third ventricle width (3VW) were also assessed annually. RESULTS: Over the period of 0-24 months, patients with MS lost significantly more GMV (-2.6% vs -0.72%, p<0.001), PGV (-2.4% vs -1.03%, p<0.001) and PBVC (-1.2% vs -0.22%, p<0.001), and increased in LVV (+16.6% vs +0.55%, p<0.003) and 3VW (+9.3% vs 0%, p = 0.003), when compared with NCs. Within-person change in MRI measures for patients with MS over 5 years was -4.2% for PBVC, -6.2% for GMV, -5.8% for PGV, -0.5% for WMV (all p<0.001), +68.7 for LVV (p<0.001), +4% for 3VW (p<0.001) and +42% for T2-LV (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirmed a different pattern of GM, WM and central atrophy progression over 2 years between patients with MS and NCs. The study showed a different evolution of tissue compartment atrophy measures in patients with MS, with faster decline in cortical and deep GM regions, as well as periventricular WM regions, over a 5-year period.
17553726	Calibration of an instrumented treatment table for measuring manual therapy forces applied to the cervical spine.	Manual therapy techniques are commonly used to treat musculoskeletal neck disorders, but little is known about the manual forces applied during cervical spine treatment. Forces may vary between practitioners, and this may affect patient outcomes. This study reports the development of an instrumented treatment table and its calibration for measuring posteroanterior-directed forces applied during cervical spine mobilisation. A treatment table surface was instrumented with seven biaxial load cells to measure manually applied forces in three planes. Accuracy of the system was evaluated using known weights (unloaded and loaded to represent a patient's body weight), selected to be consistent with the level of forces expected to be applied during cervical mobilisation. Recorded force values strongly correlated with known weights (Pearson's r=0.999 to 1.000 for forces applied in different directions and locations, unloaded and loaded). The accuracy of forces in the unloaded condition was very good for vertical forces (mean absolute error 1.1N, SD 1.5), and reasonably good for horizontal forces (2.8N, SD 2.4 for mediolateral, 3.4N, SD 1.5 for caudad-cephalad). In the loaded condition absolute error increased slightly for horizontal forces. The accuracy of measured forces indicates the instrumented table is acceptable for measuring cervical mobilisation forces. Using it allows practitioners to perform manual techniques using their usual clinical technique, however interpretation of force data is limited because it represents force applied to the table rather than at a specific joint.
17554753	Estimation of the marginal survival time in the presence of dependent competing risks using inverse probability of censoring weighted (IPCW) methods.	In medical studies, there is interest in inferring the marginal distribution of a survival time subject to competing risks. The Kyushu Lipid Intervention Study (KLIS) was a clinical study for hypercholesterolemia, where pravastatin treatment was compared with conventional treatment. The primary endpoint was time to events of coronary heart disease (CHD). In this study, however, some subjects died from causes other than CHD or were censored due to loss to follow-up. Because the treatments were targeted to reduce CHD events, the investigators were interested in the effect of the treatment on CHD events in the absence of causes of death or events other than CHD. In this paper, we present a method for estimating treatment group-specific marginal survival curves of time-to-event data in the presence of dependent competing risks. The proposed method is a straightforward extension of the Inverse Probability of Censoring Weighted (IPCW) method to settings with more than one reason for censoring. The results of our analysis showed that the IPCW marginal incidence for CHD was almost the same as the lower bound for which subjects with competing events were assumed to be censored at the end of all follow-up. This result provided reassurance that the results in KLIS were robust to competing risks.
17559415	Elevated levels of human endogenous retrovirus-W transcripts in blood cells from patients with first episode schizophrenia.	We previously reported on the differential presence of transcripts related to the human endogenous retrovirus (HERV)-W family in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma from patients with first-episode schizophrenia compared with control individuals. Whether this is a consequence of qualitative or quantitative differences in transcription of genomic regions harboring HERV-W elements is not known. The purpose of the present study was therefore to characterize the transcribed HERV-W elements in mononuclear cells obtained from 30 patients first hospitalized for schizophrenia-related psychosis and from 26 healthy control individuals. We observed elevated total levels of HERV-W gag (2.1-fold, P < 0.01) but not env transcripts in the cells of patients compared with controls. By using the melting temperatures of the amplicons as a proxy marker for sequence identity, no absolute qualitative differences was detected between the two groups. Mapping of the detected transcripts identified several intronic and intergenic HERV-W elements transcribed in the cells, including elements previously considered transcriptionally silent. Element-specific assays revealed elevated levels of intronic transcripts containing HERV-W gag sequence from the putative gene PTD015 on chromosome 11q13.5 (1.6-fold, P < 0.05) in the patients compared with the controls. Thus, studies aiming to further understanding of complex human disease such as schizophrenia may need to be extended beyond the strictly protein-coding fraction of the transcriptome.
17562213	The effects of land use changes on some soil properties in Indaği Mountain Pass--Cankiri, Turkey.	Understanding spatial variability of dynamic soil attributes provides information for suitably using land and avoiding environmental degradation. In this paper, we examined five neighboring land use types in Indagi Mountain Pass--Cankiri, Turkey to spatially predict variability of the soil organic carbon (SOC), bulk density (BD), textural composition, and soil reaction (pH) as affected by land use changes. Plantation, recreational land, and cropland were the lands converted from the woodland and grassland which were original lands in the study area. Total of 578 disturbed and undisturbed soil samples were taken with irregular intervals from five sites and represented the depths of 0-10 and 10-20 cm. Soil pH and BD had the lower coefficient of variations (CV) while SOC had the highest value for topsoil. Clay content showed greater CV than silt and sand contents. The geostatistics indicated that the soil properties examined were spatially dependent to the different degrees and interpolations using kriging showed the dynamic relationships between soil properties and land use types. The topsoil spatial distribution of SOC highly reflected the changes in the land use types, and kriging anticipated significant decreases of SOC in the recreational land and cropland. Accordingly, BD varied depending on the land use types, and also, the topsoil spatial distribution of BD differed significantly from that of the subsoil. Generally, BD greatly decreased in places where the SOC was relatively higher except in the grassland where overgrazing was the more important factor than SOC to determine BD. The topsoil spatial distributions of clay, silt, and sand contents were rather similar to those of the subsoil. The cropland and grassland were located on the very fine textured soils whereas the woodland and plantation were on the coarse textured soils. Although it was observed a clear pattern for the spatial distributions of the clay and sand changing with land uses, this was not the case for the silt content, which was attributed to the differences of dynamic erosional processes in the area. The spatial distribution of the soil pH agreed with that of the clay content. Soils of the cropland and grassland with higher amounts of clay characteristically binding more cations and having higher buffering capacities had the greater pH values when compared to the soils of other land uses with higher amounts of sand naturally inclined to be washed from the base cations by the rainwater.
17562214	Definition and feasibility of isolation distances for transgenic maize cultivation.	A major concern related to the adoption of genetically modified (GM) crops in agricultural systems is the possibility of unwanted GM inputs into non-GM crop production systems. Given the increasing commercial cultivation of GM crops in the European Union (EU), there is an urgent need to define measures to prevent mixing of GM with non-GM products during crop production. Cross-fertilization is one of the various mechanisms that could lead to GM-inputs into non-GM crop systems. Isolation distances between GM and non-GM fields are widely accepted to be an effective measure to reduce these inputs. However, the question of adequate isolation distances between GM and non-GM maize is still subject of controversy both amongst scientists and regulators. As several European countries have proposed largely differing isolation distances for maize ranging from 25 to 800 m, there is a need for scientific criteria when using cross-fertilization data of maize to define isolation distances between GM and non-GM maize. We have reviewed existing cross-fertilization studies in maize, established relevant criteria for the evaluation of these studies and applied these criteria to define science-based isolation distances. To keep GM-inputs in the final product well below the 0.9% threshold defined by the EU, isolation distances of 20 m for silage and 50 m for grain maize, respectively, are proposed. An evaluation using statistical data on maize acreage and an aerial photographs assessment of a typical agricultural landscape by means of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) showed that spatial resources would allow applying the defined isolation distances for the cultivation of GM maize in the majority of the cases under actual Swiss agricultural conditions. The here developed approach, using defined criteria to consider the agricultural context of maize cultivation, may be of assistance for the analysis of cross-fertilization data in other countries.
17562543	The receptor attributable to C-type natriuretic peptide-induced differentiation of osteoblasts is switched from type B- to type C-natriuretic peptide receptor with aging.	C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) stimulates the differentiation and inhibits the proliferation of osteoblastic lineage cells. In this study, we examined whether the effects of CNP on osteoblastic functions change with aging using calvarial osteoblast-like cells from 25-week-old (young) and 120-week-old (aged) rats. CNP inhibited DNA synthesis and stimulated collagen synthesis and mineralized bone nodule formation. These effects were less pronounced in aged rat cells, suggesting the age-related attenuation of CNP-induced signaling. They were also blocked by the treatment of young rat cells with KT5823, a protein kinase G (PKG) inhibitor, but not by the treatment of aged rat cells with KT5823. CNP stimulated cGMP production in young rat cells, but not in aged rat cells. Natriuretic peptide receptor (NPR)-B, which has a guanylyl cyclase activity domain, and NPR-C, which has no enzyme activity domain, were predominantly expressed in young and aged rat cells, respectively. C-ANF, an NPR-C agonist, mimicked the effects of CNP on the proliferation and differentiation of aged rat cells; these effects were inhibited by the treatment with pertussis toxin (PTX), a Gi protein inhibitor. CNP and C-ANF evoked intracellular levels of inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate and Ca(2+), which are markers for phospholiase C (PLC) activation, in aged rat cells, and the effects of these two peptides were also blocked by the treatment with PTX. From these results, we concluded that CNP acts as a positive regulator of bone formation by osteoblasts and that the signaling pathway for CNP is switched from NPR-B/cGMP/PKG to NPR-C/G(i) protein/PLC with aging.
17562544	Nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), an inhibitor of the HER2 and IGF-1 receptor tyrosine kinases, blocks the growth of HER2-overexpressing human breast cancer cells.	We have reported that nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) inhibits the tyrosine kinase activities of the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) and the HER2 receptor in breast cancer cells. Herein, we studied the effects of NDGA on the growth of estrogen receptor (ER) positive MCF-7 cells engineered to overexpress HER2 (MCF-7/HER2-18). These cells are an in vitro model of HER2-driven, ER positive, tamoxifen resistant breast cancer. NDGA was equally effective at inhibiting the growth of both parental MCF-7 and MCF-7/HER2-18 cells. Half maximal effects for both cell lines were in the 10-15 microM range. The growth inhibitory effects of NDGA were associated with an S phase arrest in the cell cycle and the induction of apoptosis. NDGA inhibited both IGF-1R and HER2 kinase activities in these breast cancer cells. In contrast, Gefitinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor but not an IGF-1R inhibitor, was more effective in MCF-7/HER2-18 cells than in the parental MCF-7 cells and IGF binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) was more effective against MCF-7 cells compared to MCF-7/HER2-18. MCF-7/HER2-18 cells are known to be resistant to the effects of the estrogen receptor inhibitor, tamoxifen. Interestingly, NDGA not only inhibited the growth of MCF-7/HER2-18 on its own, but it also demonstrated additive growth inhibitory effects when combined with tamoxifen. These studies suggest that NDGA may have therapeutic benefits in HER2-positive, tamoxifen resistant, breast cancers in humans.
17562554	Myo-inositol: a marker of reactive astrogliosis in glial tumors?	In a prospective study, two-dimensional (1)H-MRS with TE of 30 ms was performed before surgery in 56 patients with glial brain tumors. Concentrations of myo-inositol (MI), trimethylamine (TMA) and creatine/phosphocreatine (tCr) were evaluated for the whole tumor and scaled to the normal-appearing contralateral brain tissue. To assign changes in MI to specific tissue pathology, the normalized peak and mean concentrations of MI were correlated with TMA and tCr concentrations. TMA is accepted as a marker of proliferating tumor tissue, and tCr might be a marker of reactive astrogliosis. The mean and peak concentrations of MI and tCr correlated positively (r = 0.7), but not the concentrations of MI and TMA. The absolute concentration of MI was significantly increased in all tumor tissues (5.55 +/- 2.92 mM; mean +/- SD) compared with the normal-appearing white matter (4.33 +/- 1.22 mM, p = 0.005), with the highest concentrations for gliomatoses (n = 10) and grade II oligoastrocytomas (n = 3). Significant differences (P = 0.004) between low- and high-grade astrocytomas were found for TMA (1.67 +/- 0.32 mM and 2.65 +/- 0.86 mM, respectively), but not for MI (5.92 +/- 1.98 mM and 5.49 +/- 3.27 mM, respectively). As increased MI and tCr concentrations were found in gliomatosis and other cerebral diseases associated with marked astrogliosis, this process may also be responsible for the observed changes in MI in other glial tumors.
17569714	Development and psychometric evaluation of a Catalan self- and interviewer-administered version of the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory version 4.0.	OBJECTIVE: The purposes of this study were to develop and to assess the psychometric properties of a Catalan self- and interviewer-administered version of the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory Generic Core Scales (PedsQL) with a sample of schoolchildren, and to examine the equivalence between both versions. METHODS: 511 schoolchildren aged between 9 and 17 years old participated in the study. In addition to completing a Catalan self-administered version of the PedsQL, each child was interviewed individually. RESULTS: Confirmatory factor analysis did not support the original Varni's proposal. Instead, a short 12-item version was derived. The higher-order scales for both versions were internally consistent. Moreover, relationships between ratings of children's quality of life were generally significant; both versions were also found to be related with another measure of quality of life supporting their validity. CONCLUSIONS: A new administration form for the PedsQL is presented in this study. The psychometric properties of both self- and interviewer-administered short 12-item versions are reassuring albeit with a few areas of improvement. Further studies are needed to investigate whether self- and interviewer-administered versions can really be considered to be comparable.
17570454	Pharmacokinetics of florfenicol and its metabolite, florfenicol amine, in dogs.	A study on the bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of florfenicol was conducted in six healthy dogs following a single intravenous (i.v.) or oral (p.o.) dose of 20 mg kg(-1) body weight (b.w.). Florfenicol concentrations in serum were determined by a high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Plasma concentration-time data after p.o. or i.v. administration were analyzed by a non-compartmental analysis. Following i.v. injection, the total body clearance was 1.03 (0.49) L kg(-1)h(-1) and the volume of distribution at steady-state was 1.45 (0.82) L kg(-1). Florfenicol was rapidly distributed and eliminated following i.v. injection with 1.11 (0.94)h of the elimination half-life. After oral administration, the calculated mean C(max) values (6.18 microg ml(-1)) were reached at 0.94 h in dogs. The elimination half-life of florfenicol was 1.24 (0.64) h and the absolute bioavailability (F) was achieved 95.43 (11.60)% after oral administration of florfenicol. Florfenicol amine, the major metabolite of florfenicol, was detected in all dogs after i.v. and p.o. administrations.
17570583	Adsorption of naphthalene onto the carbon adsorbent from waste ion exchange resin: equilibrium and kinetic characteristics.	Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are widespread environmental pollutants that can result in serious health problems and genetic defects in humans. In this research, a spherical microporous carbon adsorbent (CR-1) had been obtained by carbonization and activation of the waste polysulfonated cation exchange resin. Naphthalene was adopted as a model compound to examine the adsorption effectiveness for removing PAHs from the aqueous solution by CR-1. Nonlinear isotherms models, i.e., Freundlich, Langmuir, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller and Polanyi-Dubinin-Manes models were tested to fit experimental data. The adsorption equilibrium data of naphthalene on CR-1 was fitted well by the Polanyi-Dubinin-Manes model. Through both isotherm modeling and constructing "characteristic curve", Polanyi theory was useful to describe the adsorption process of naphthalene by CR-1, providing evidence that a micropore filling phenomenon is involved. In addition, among the tested kinetic models in this study (e.g., pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order equations), the pseudo-first-order equation successfully predicted the kinetic adsorption process.
17570588	A systematic literature review of psychological factors and the development of late whiplash syndrome.	This systematic literature review aims to assess the prognostic value of psychological factors in the development of late whiplash syndrome (LWS). We included prospective cohort studies that provided a baseline measure of at least one psychological variable and used outcome measures relating to LWS (i.e. pain or disability persisting 6 months post injury). A search of electronic databases (Pubmed, Medline, Cinahl, Embase and Psychinfo) up to August 2006 was done using a predetermined search strategy. Methodological quality was assessed independently by two assessors. Data extraction were carried out using a standardised data extraction form. Twenty-five articles representing data from 17 cohorts were included. Fourteen articles were rated as low quality with 11 rated as adequate quality. Meta-analysis was not undertaken due to the heterogeneity of prognostic factors, outcome measures and methods used. Results were tabulated and predefined criterion applied to rate the overall strength of evidence for associations between psychological factors and LWS. Data on 21 possible psychological risk factors were included. The majority of findings were inconclusive. Limited evidence was found to support an association between lower self-efficacy and greater post-traumatic stress with the development of LWS. No association was found between the development of LWS and personality traits, general psychological distress, wellbeing, social support, life control and psychosocial work factors. The lack of conclusive findings and poor methodological quality of the studies reviewed highlights the need for better quality research. Self-efficacy and post-traumatic distress may be associated with the development of LWS but this needs further investigation.
17571210	The 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase multienzyme complex of Haloferax volcanii.	Those aerobic archaea whose genomes have been sequenced possess four adjacent genes that, by sequence comparisons with bacteria and eukarya, appear to encode the component enzymes of a 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase multienzyme complex. However, no catalytic activity of any such complex has ever been detected in the archaea. In Thermoplasma acidophilum, evidence has been presented that the heterologously expressed recombinant enzyme possesses activity with the branched chain 2-oxoacids and, to a lesser extent, with pyruvate. In the current paper, we demonstrate that in Haloferax volcanii the four genes are transcribed as an operon in vivo. However, no functional complex or individual enzyme, except for the dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase component, could be detected in this halophile grown on a variety of carbon sources. Dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase is present at low catalytic activities, the level of which is increased three to fourfold when Haloferax volcanii is grown on the branched-chain amino acids valine, leucine and isoleucine.
17572067	Electrotherapy and the human voice: a literature review of the historical origins and contemporary applications.	SUMMARY: The present article surveys the literature on the electrotherapy treatment for voice disorders from the mid-18th century to World War I (1914--1918) and the post 1970s reappearance of such therapies. The reappearance of electrotherapy as treatment for voice disorders in the past 20 years has been heralded as a major breakthrough. In light of our reading of the scientific literature of the 19th century, it can be shown to repeat many of the presuppositions of electrotherapists of that time. The current resurgence of interest and research in electrical stimulation of the larynx is buoyed by technological innovations analogous to those in the 19th century. Although the current state of research has enhanced our understanding of vocal fold physiology, it does not necessarily provide a new therapeutic approach as a survey of the most recent literature shows.
17574340	Classification of heterogeneous electron microscopic projections into homogeneous subsets.	The co-existence of different states of a macromolecular complex in samples used by three-dimensional electron microscopy (3D-EM) constitutes a serious challenge. The single particle method applied directly to such heterogeneous sets is unable to provide useful information about the encountered conformational diversity and produces reconstructions with severely reduced resolution. One approach to solving this problem is to partition heterogeneous projection set into homogeneous components and apply existing reconstruction techniques to each of them. Due to the nature of the projection images and the high noise level present in them, this classification task is difficult. A method is presented to achieve the desired classification by using a novel image similarity measure and solving the corresponding optimization problem. Unlike the majority of competing approaches, the presented method employs unsupervised classification (it does not require any prior knowledge about the objects being classified) and does not involve a 3D reconstruction procedure. We demonstrate a fast implementation of this method, capable of classifying projection sets that originate from 3D-EM. The method's performance is evaluated on synthetically generated data sets produced by projecting 3D objects that resemble biological structures.
17574365	Central neurocytoma: typical magnetic resonance spectroscopy findings and atypical ventricular dissemination.	PURPOSE: Central neurocytomas (CNCs) are rare neuronal tumors that have a favorable prognosis and lower rate of recurrence compared with other intraventricular neoplasms. Although it may be difficult to distinguish CNC on conventional neuroimaging, typical MR spectroscopy (MRS) features have been reported. We describe the MRI and MRS features of CNC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight patients with CNC were reviewed. Three patients underwent presurgical in vivo single-voxel MRS at short echo time (TE, 35 ms) and multi-voxel MR spectroscopic imaging at long TE (144 ms). The surgically resected tumor specimen of one of these patients was also studied ex vivo using high-resolution magic angle spinning (HRMAS) nuclear magnetic resonance. RESULTS: All eight tumors were located in the lateral ventricles. In six patients, CNC extended into the third ventricle, and in two patients the tumor showed further contiguous intraventricular dissemination into the fourth ventricle. In all three patients who underwent MRS, a characteristic metabolite peak was detected at 3.55 parts per million (ppm) at both long and short TE. HRMAS confirmed the presence of elevated glycine (Gly) at 3.55 ppm, without increase in the concentration of myo-inositol found at the same chemical shift. Elevated choline (at 3.2 ppm) was also seen in all three patients. CONCLUSION: On MRS, CNCs have a typical appearance with a metabolite peak at 3.55 ppm due to increased Gly, and this feature may be helpful in presurgical diagnosis. Although they are rare benign intraventricular tumors, in atypical cases, CNCs can show extensive intraventricular dissemination into the fourth ventricle.
17574685	Prediction of the three-year course of recurrent depression in primary care patients: different risk factors for different outcomes.	BACKGROUND: The objectives of this study are: (1) identification of predictors for the three-year course of recurrent depression in the rarely studied, but relevant sample of primary care patients, and (2) investigation whether different outcome indicators, time to recurrence, proportion depression-free time and mean severity of depressive symptoms during follow-up, are associated with different risk factors. METHODS: Depression course was established by assessing 110 patients three-monthly with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview and the BDI, during a three-year period. Eight (groups of) predictors, assessed at baseline, were examined: socio-demographics, parental depression, history and severity of depression, anxiety, coping potential, social dysfunctioning and physical functioning. RESULTS: Time to recurrence was predicted by number of previous episodes (OR=1.91). Both proportion depressive disorder-free time and mean depression severity during follow-up were predicted by: severity of depression (B=-.19 and .21 respectively), anxiety (B=-.32 and .33), social dysfunctioning (B=-.21 and .22) and physical functioning (B=.24 and -.39). Mean severity was additionally predicted by: educational level (B=-.21), duration of the longest prior episode (B=.32), and coping potential (B=-.40). Coping potential and number of previous episodes were marginally significant predictors for all three outcomes. LIMITATIONS: Although substantial, sample size was restricted. CONCLUSION: Different outcome variables are predicted by different risk factors. Restriction to one outcome may lead to missing important determinants of the depression course. Number of prior episodes and coping potential seem to warrant special attention from the GP.
17574741	Growth response of Zea mays L. in pyrene-copper co-contaminated soil and the fate of pollutants.	Phytoremediation, use of plants for remediation, is an emerging technology for treating heavy metals or a final polishing step for the high-level organic contamination, and may be suitable for remediation of heavy metal and organic co-contaminated soil. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of co-contamination on the growth of Zea mays L. and the fate of both heavy metal and organic pollutants, using Cu and pyrene as the model pollutants. Results showed that shoot and root biomass were affected by the copper-pyrene co-contamination, although maize grown in spiked soils showed no outward signs of phytotoxicity. With the initial concentration of 50,100 and 500 mg/kg, pyrene tended to alleviate the inhibition of Cu to Z. mays L. Pyrene in both planted and non-planted soil was greatly decreased at the end of the 4-week culture, accounting for 16-18% of initial extractable concentrations in non-planted soil and 9-14% in planted soil, which indicated that the dissipation of soil pyrene was enhanced in the presence of vegetation probably due to the biodegradation and association with the soil matrix. With the increment of Cu level, residual pyrene in the planted soil tended to increase. The pyrene residual in the presence of high concentration of Cu was even higher in the planted soil than that in the non-planted soil, which suggested that the change of the microbial composition and microbial activity or the modified root physiology under Cu stress was probably unbeneficial to the dissipation of pyrene. A more thorough understanding of the mechanisms by which metals affect the dissipation of organic pollutants in the rhizosphere could provide a much better framework on which to base manipulation. Unlike pyrene, heavy metal copper cannot be degraded. Decontamination of Cu from contaminated soils in this system required the removal of Cu by plants. It was observed that the ability of Cu phytoextraction would be inhibited under co-contamination of high level of pyrene in highly Cu-polluted soil. In the treatment of 400 mg Cu/kg and 500 mg pyrene/kg, the accumulation of Cu was less than half of that in 400 mg Cu/kg treatment.
17577201	Developmental and genetic mechanisms for evolutionary diversification of serial repeats: eyespot size in Bicyclus anynana butterflies.	Serially repeated pattern elements on butterfly wings offer the opportunity for integrating genetic, developmental, and functional aspects towards understanding morphological diversification and the evolution of individuality. We use captive populations of Bicyclus anynana butterflies, an emerging model in evolutionary developmental biology, to explore the genetic and developmental basis of compartmentalized changes in eyespot patterns. There is much variation for different aspects of eyespot morphology, and knowledge about the genetic pathways and developmental processes involved in eyespot formation. Also, despite the strong correlations across all eyespots in one butterfly, B. anynana shows great potential for independent changes in the size of individual eyespots. It is, however, unclear to what extent the genetic and developmental processes underlying eyespot formation change in a localized manner to enable such individualization. We use micromanipulations of developing wings to dissect the contribution of different components of eyespot development to quantitative differences in eyespot size on one wing surface. Reciprocal transplants of presumptive eyespot foci between artificial selection lines and controls suggest that while localized antagonistic changes in eyespot size rely mostly on localized changes in focal signal strength, concerted changes depend greatly on epidermal response sensitivities. This potentially reflects differences between the signal-response components of eyespot formation in the degrees of compartmentalization and/or the temporal pattern of selection. We also report on the phenotypic analysis of a number of mutant stocks demonstrating how single alleles can affect different eyespots in concert or independently, and thus contribute to the individualization of serially repeated traits.
17579608	Association of DISC1 with autism and Asperger syndrome.	The DISC1 gene at 1q42 has generated considerable interest in various psychiatric diseases, since a balanced translocation interrupting the gene was found to cosegregate with schizophrenia and related mental illnesses in a large Scottish pedigree. To date, linkage and association findings to this locus have been replicated in several study samples ascertained for psychotic disorders. However, the biological function of DISC1 in neuronal development would suggest a potential role for this gene also in other, early onset neuropsychiatric disorders. Here we have addressed the allelic diversity of the DISC1, DISC2 and TRAX genes, clustered in 1q42, in Finnish families ascertained for infantile autism (97 families, n(affected)=138) and Asperger syndrome (29 families, n(affected)=143). We established association between autism and a DISC1 intragenic microsatellite (D1S2709; P=0.004). In addition, evidence for association to Asperger syndrome was observed with an intragenic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of DISC1 (rs1322784; P=0.0058), as well as with a three-SNP haplotype (P=0.0013) overlapping the HEP3 haplotype, that was previously observed to associate with schizophrenia in Finnish families. The strongest associations were obtained with broad diagnostic categories for both disorders and with affected males only, in agreement with the previous sex-dependent effects reported for DISC1. These results would further support the involvement of DISC1 gene also in the etiopathogenesis of early onset neuropsychiatric disorders.
17579866	Efficacy of Hsp90 inhibition for induction of apoptosis and inhibition of growth in cervical carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo.	PURPOSE: Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is a conserved chaperone involved in crucial signaling events in normal and malignant cells. Previous research suggests that tumor cells are particularly dependent on Hsp90 for survival as well as malignant progression. Hsp90 inhibitors which are derivates of the natural compound geldanamycin, such as the orally bioavailable 17-(dimethylaminoethylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMAG), are currently being tested in clinical trials and small molecule inhibitors are in development. In this study we investigated the response of a panel of cervical carcinoma cell lines in vitro and in vivo to determine potential factors that might influence the sensitivity towards Hsp90 inhibition. METHODS: Cell viability, proliferation and drug-induced changes on Hsp90 chaperoned "client" factors were examined with focus on G2/M cell cycle regulators, and a comparison with immortalized and normal keratinocytes was performed. ME180 and CaSki cells were grown as subcutaneous xenografts in mice treated with 6-10 mg/kg 17-DMAG by oral gavage 2x/day on a chronic schedule. Tissue concentrations of 17-DMAG were measured by high performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Cell death during abnormal mitosis was observed within 48 h after treatment start. ME180 and CaSki showed more cell death at this time point than SiHa and HeLa, and higher levels of pre-treatment Akt activity. IC(50) values ranged between 17 and 37 nanoM geldanamycin (MTS). Keratinocytes were at least as sensitive as carcinoma cells. All cell lines responded with an increase of the G2/M fraction. Despite in vitro effectiveness and tissue concentrations of 1 microM, only a limited tumor growth reduction was observed with 17-DMAG given close to the maximum tolerated dose level. Lower levels of Hsp90 protein, a lower Akt activity and signs of tissue hypoxia were observed in xenografts compared to cell cultures. CONCLUSIONS: We show here that Hsp90 inhibition effectively induces apoptosis and growth arrest in cervical carcinoma cells in vitro. Mitotic catastrophe was identified as one mechanism of cell death. In contrast, a limited efficacy of 17-DMAG was observed in subcutaneous xenograft models. Induction of a heat shock response has previously been implicated in resistance towards Hsp90 inhibition. Additional factors might be (1) an altered abundance and/or activity of primary (Hsp90) and secondary (e.g., Akt) target(s), (2) a narrow therapeutic range of 17-DMAG by oral application and (3) response-modifying factors within the tumor environment. The further development of synthetic Hsp90 inhibitors with increased therapeutic window is warranted.
17581763	Relationship between serum acute phase protein concentrations and lesions in finishing pigs.	To establish the relationship between serum levels of three acute phase proteins, haptoglobin (Hp), C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid A (SAA), and the occurrence and severity of lesions at slaughter, a study was carried out using 70 fattening pigs from a finishing unit. Pigs were divided into three groups: Group 1 (25 pigs with clinical signs of disease), Group 2 (25 apparently healthy pigs with lesions at slaughter) and Group 3 (20 apparently healthy pigs with no lesions at slaughter). Serum levels of CRP, SAA and Hp were significantly higher in pigs with clinical signs of disease than in apparently healthy animals. Additionally, in apparently healthy pigs, serum levels of Hp and CRP were significantly higher in animals with lesions than those without lesions. The extent and severity of lung lesions were related to serum levels of Hp.
17587519	The nocturnal oviposition behaviour of blowflies (Diptera: Calliphoridae) in Central Europe and its forensic implications.	Numerous factors may cause delayed colonisation of a corpse by blowflies, leading to a discrepancy between the entomologically determined post-mortem interval (PMI) and the time of death. Blowflies, for example, are considered to be inactive at night, however, published observations are contradictory. In the present study, several field experiments and one type of indoor experiment were conducted in summer of 2004 and 2005 in order to investigate the nocturnal ovipositional behaviour of blowflies. In the field, two types of bait, dead hedgehogs and fresh beef liver, were placed at night in different urban and rural locations in Frankfurt and in Munich, Germany. For the indoor-experiments beef liver was placed in small plastic boxes containing caged Lucilia sericata females in the evening and left overnight. At night, no ovipositon was observed in the field (n=51, T=10-24 degrees C). Nocturnal oviposition in complete darkness occurred in the plastic boxes in two of six cases (T=25 degrees C). Considering the behavioural and physiological characteristics of flies we suggest that nocturnal oviposition of blowflies appears to be unlikely under natural conditions in Central Europe but may occur under certain circumstances, such as unusual high nightly temperatures and the presence of gravid flies with an appropriate arousal threshold.
17588864	On the Heun equation.	A new approach to the theory of finite-gap integration for the Heun equation is constructed. As an application, global monodromies of the Heun equation are calculated and expressed as hyperelliptic integrals. The relationship between the Heun equation and the spectral problem for the BC1 Inozemtsev model is also discussed.
17591439	An overview of enzymatic production of biodiesel.	Biodiesel production has received considerable attention in the recent past as a biodegradable and nonpolluting fuel. The production of biodiesel by transesterification process employing alkali catalyst has been industrially accepted for its high conversion and reaction rates. Recently, enzymatic transesterification has attracted much attention for biodiesel production as it produces high purity product and enables easy separation from the byproduct, glycerol. But the cost of enzyme remains a barrier for its industrial implementation. In order to increase the cost effectiveness of the process, the enzyme (both intracellular and extracellular) is reused by immobilizing in a suitable biomass support particle and that has resulted in considerable increase in efficiency. But the activity of immobilized enzyme is inhibited by methanol and glycerol which are present in the reacting mixture. The use of tert-butanol as solvent, continuous removal of glycerol, stepwise addition of methanol are found to reduce the inhibitory effects thereby increasing the cost effectiveness of the process. The present review analyzes these methods reported in literature and also suggests a suitable method for commercialization of the enzymatic process.
17595018	A functional MRI study of amygdala responses to angry schematic faces in social anxiety disorder.	Neuroimaging studies using angry or contemptuous human facial photographic stimuli have suggested amygdala hyper-responsivity in social anxiety disorder (SAD). We sought to determine if an angry "schematic face" (simple line drawing) would evoke exaggerated amygdalar responses in SAD patients compared with healthy control (HC) subjects. Angry, happy, and neutral schematic faces were overtly presented to matched cohorts of 11 SAD and 11 HC subjects for passive viewing, whereas brain functional magnetic resonance imaging signal was measured at 1.5 Tesla. Voxel-wise analyses were performed using a random effects model in SPM99. Compared with HC subjects, SAD patients exhibited exaggerated responses in the right amygdala for the Angry versus Neutral contrast. The findings of exaggerated amygdala responses to angry schematic faces in SAD converge with results from earlier neuroimaging studies and illustrate the potential utility of schematic faces for probing amygdala function in psychiatric disorders. One prospective advantage of schematic faces is that they may minimize confounds related to gender, age, or race effects. However, extending earlier findings in healthy subjects, schematic faces appear more effective for probing amygdala responses to arousal-based (Angry versus Neutral) as opposed to valence-based (Angry versus Happy) contrasts.
17603050	Differing mechanisms of meiotic segregation in spermatozoa from three carriers of a pericentric inversion of chromosome 8.	OBJECTIVE: To determine the meiotic segregation of a pericentric inversion of chromosome 8 in three carriers. DESIGN: Analysis of sperm nuclei by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). SETTING: University hospital. PATIENT(S): Three males with an inv(8). INTERVENTION(S): Triple FISH with the 8q and 8p subtelomeres and the specific alphoid of chromosome 9 probes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Meiotic segregation differences between carriers. RESULT(S): The frequencies of nonrecombinant gametes were 97%, 60.94%, and 61.03%. The frequencies of recombinant sperm were 1.44%, 37.71%, and 37.70%, whereas the size of the inverted segment represented 31%, 61%, and 80% of the size of the whole chromosome 8. CONCLUSION(S): Many factors seem to influence the production of recombinant chromosomes: the affected chromosome and involved region, location of the breakpoints, or size of the inverted segment. Our results show that the rate of recombination varies principally according to the size of the inverted segment.
17604112	Benchmarking protein classification algorithms via supervised cross-validation.	Development and testing of protein classification algorithms are hampered by the fact that the protein universe is characterized by groups vastly different in the number of members, in average protein size, similarity within group, etc. Datasets based on traditional cross-validation (k-fold, leave-one-out, etc.) may not give reliable estimates on how an algorithm will generalize to novel, distantly related subtypes of the known protein classes. Supervised cross-validation, i.e., selection of test and train sets according to the known subtypes within a database has been successfully used earlier in conjunction with the SCOP database. Our goal was to extend this principle to other databases and to design standardized benchmark datasets for protein classification. Hierarchical classification trees of protein categories provide a simple and general framework for designing supervised cross-validation strategies for protein classification. Benchmark datasets can be designed at various levels of the concept hierarchy using a simple graph-theoretic distance. A combination of supervised and random sampling was selected to construct reduced size model datasets, suitable for algorithm comparison. Over 3000 new classification tasks were added to our recently established protein classification benchmark collection that currently includes protein sequence (including protein domains and entire proteins), protein structure and reading frame DNA sequence data. We carried out an extensive evaluation based on various machine-learning algorithms such as nearest neighbor, support vector machines, artificial neural networks, random forests and logistic regression, used in conjunction with comparison algorithms, BLAST, Smith-Waterman, Needleman-Wunsch, as well as 3D comparison methods DALI and PRIDE. The resulting datasets provide lower, and in our opinion more realistic estimates of the classifier performance than do random cross-validation schemes. A combination of supervised and random sampling was used to construct model datasets, suitable for algorithm comparison.
17605838	Labelling the salt content in foods: a useful tool in reducing sodium intake in Finland.	OBJECTIVE: To estimate the impact of choosing food products labelled either as low or high in salt on salt intake in the Finnish adult population. SETTING AND SUBJECTS: The National FINDIET 2002 survey with 48-hour recalls from 2007 subjects aged 25-64 years. Sodium intake was calculated based on the Fineli food composition database including the sodium content of natural and processed foods as well as the salt content of recipes. The distribution of salt intake was calculated in different ways: the present situation; assuming that all breads, cheeses, processed meat and fish, breakfast cereals and fat spreads consumed would be either 'lightly salted' or 'heavily salted' based on the current labelling practice; and, in addition, assuming that all foods would be prepared with 50% less or more salt. RESULTS: Excluding underreporters, the mean salt intake would be reduced by 1.8 g in men and by 1.0 g in women if the entire population were to choose lightly salted products and further by 2.5 and 1.8 g, respectively, if also salt used in cooking were halved. Choosing heavily salted products would increase salt intake by 2.1 g in men and by 1.4 g in women. In the worst scenarios, salt intake would be further increased by 2.3 g in men and by 1.6 g in women. CONCLUSIONS: These calculations show that the potential impact of labelling and giving consumers the possibility to choose products with less salt is of public health importance. In addition, strategies to reduce the salt content of all food groups are needed.
17606361	Examining content specificity of negative interpretation biases with the Body Sensations Interpretation Questionnaire (BSIQ).	Cognitive biases have been suggested to act as latent vulnerability factors for the onset and maintenance of affective and emotional disorders. Additionally, several global and specific personality constructs are known to influence the course of psychopathology (e.g., trait anxiety, optimism, anxiety sensitivity (AS), injury/illness sensitivity (IS), fear of negative evaluation (FNE)). The current study examined the specificity of the relation between these constructs and a negative interpretation bias. One hundred and fifty-four healthy participants completed the Body Sensations Interpretation Questionnaire (BSIQ) [Clark, D. A., Salkovskis, P. M., Breitholtz, E., Westling, B. E., Ost, L.-G., Koehler, K. A., et al. (1997). Misinterpretation of body sensations in panic disorder. Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 65, 203-213], measuring negative interpretations on four domains. A confirmatory factor analysis offered support for four factors in the BSIQ. Multiple linear regression analyses demonstrated that optimism is predictive of less negative interpretations. AS, IS, and FNE are specifically predictive of negative interpretations on the panic, other bodily symptoms, and social situations subscale, respectively. In addition, specific pain-related constructs were found most predictive of the other bodily sensations subscale. It is concluded that individual variability in global and specific psychological constructs is associated with a content-specific negative interpretation bias.
17607503	The modulating role of dissolved organic matter on spatial patterns of microbial metabolism in Lake Erie sediments.	To evaluate the role of dissolved organic matter (DOM) on microbial community metabolism, we established extracellular enzyme activity (EEA) and substrate-induced respiration (SIR) profiles of sediment samples collected from littoral and profundal regions of the western, central, and eastern basins of Lake Erie. Lake Erie is spatially structured such that the central and western basins receive relatively major inputs of allochthonous DOM in comparison to the eastern basin. Overall, spatial patterns of EEA and SIR profiles suggest both greater metabolic diversity and activity in the littoral regions of the central and western basins. In contrast, the eastern basin demonstrated much less structuring between littoral and profundal areas. To evaluate whether the observed spatial patterns are the result of microbial community adaptations to local DOM availability, we performed three experimental treatments by inoculating sediment samples with polyvinylpyrrolidone, which sequesters large polyphenols, or with either vanillin or catechol, two small phenolic compounds. Our results revealed that esterase and glycosidase EEA from the eastern basin were induced by small phenolics and inhibited by large polyphenols. In contrast, the addition of small phenolics decreased esterase and glycosidase activities from the central basin, while polyphenols had a negligible effect. These results suggest that the source and composition of DOM play a significant role in the local adaptation of microbial communities, determining large-scale spatial patterns of microbial functional diversity in Lake Erie sediments.
17607511	Bone-like matrix formation on magnesium and magnesium alloys.	Mg metal and its alloys have promise as a biocompatible, degradable biomaterials. This work evaluates the potential of in vitro cell culture work with osteoblast-like cells on Mg based materials, and investigates cell differentiation and growth on Mg alloyed with various non-toxic or low-toxicity elements. Mg based substrates support the adhesion, differentiation and growth of stromal cells towards an osteoblast-like phenotype with the subsequent production of a bone like matrix under in vitro conditions. No significant difference in the final tissue layer is observed on pure Mg, an AZ21 alloy or a 0.5 wt% Ca alloy. Only a 0.8 wt% Ca alloy which shows complete structural disintegration shows minimal cell growth. Due to association of non-soluble degradation products formed when Mg is incubated in physiological-like fluid, mass changes typically used to report Mg degradation are not viable estimates of degradation. Methods quantifying the time dependent change in the mechanical integrity of samples as a function of incubation time are required for a proper assessment of Mg degradation. We conclude that in vitro cell culture of bone cells on Mg substrates is expected to be a viable screening technique to assess the relative biological activity of Mg-based materials.
17607763	Fibroin/collagen hybrid hydrogels with crosslinking method: preparation, properties, and cytocompatibility.	Substrate stiffness is an important physical factor in the response of many cell types. Although protein-based hydrogels are widely used as cell-culture substrates because of their resemblance to the natural extracellular matrix (ECM) and complex signaling, their rigidity should be further increased to facilitate the adhesion and growth of cells. In this study, fibroin/collagen hydrogels having suitable stiffness were prepared directly by adding 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminoprophy) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) in fibroin/collagen solution to induce crosslinking. The storage moduli of these crosslinked hydrogels are above 3 kPa, and even exceed 10 kPa, having stronger mechanical strength than that of previously reported protein-based hydrogels. Furthermore, the crosslinked hydrogels can maintain their configuration above 80(o)C, which proves their increased thermal stability. Although crosslinked, the hydrogels still maintain the mobility of fibroin molecules. The growth of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in fibroin/collagen gels indicates that the crosslinking reaction has no negative influence on the biocompatibility of fibroin/collagen hydrogels. The fibroin/collagen hydrogels are more propitious to the growth of cells compared with fibroin/collagen scaffolds. Because of their inherent biocompatibility, excellent mechanical and thermal properties, and green preparation process, the fibroin/collagen hydrogels would become promising scaffolds for tissue engineering.
17610752	National fortification of staple foods can make a significant contribution to micronutrient intake of South African adults.	BACKGROUND: A national survey found that micronutrient deficiencies are prevalent in South African children, particularly calcium, iron, zinc, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, folate, vitamin A, E and C. Mandatory fortification of maize meal and wheat flour were introduced in 2003 to combat some of the deficiencies found in children. To date however, there has not been a national survey on dietary intake in adults. OBJECTIVES: The main objectives of this study were to evaluate the micronutrient intake of the diet consumed by the average adult South African by means of secondary data analyses and secondly to evaluate the effects of fortification on selected nutrient intakes. STUDY DESIGN: Secondary data analysis was carried out with numerous dietary surveys on adults to create a database that included sampling (and weighting) according to ethnic/urban-rural residence in line with the population census, of which 79% were black Africans and the majority resided in rural areas. The effect of fortification was evaluated by substituting fortified foods in the diet for the unfortified products. SUBJECTS: The combined database used in this study comprised 3229 adults. RESULTS: Mean calcium, iron, folate and vitamin B6 intakes were very low particularly in women. Mean intakes of most micronutrients were lower in rural areas. Fortification of maize meal and wheat flour (bread) raised mean levels of thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6 and folate above the recommended nutrient intakes (RNIs). In women, despite fortification, mean iron intakes remained below the RNIs, as did calcium since it was not in the fortification mix. CONCLUSION: The average dietary intake of adults was of poor nutrient density, particularly in rural areas. Fortification of maize meal and wheat flour (bread) considerably improved mean vitamin B6, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, folate and iron intakes as well as the overall mean adequacy ratio of the diet.
17610756	Traditional food diversity predicts dietary quality for the Awajún in the Peruvian Amazon.	OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to assess the potential for evaluating strengths of the Awajún traditional food system using dietary assessment, a traditional food diversity score and ranking of local foods. DESIGN: The method was used for dietary data obtained from mothers and children in the Awajún culture of the Peruvian Amazon where >90% of the dietary energy is derived from local, traditional food. Traditional food diversity scores were calculated from repeat 24-hour recalls. Group mean intakes of energy, fat, protein, iron, vitamin A and vitamin C from each food item were used to rank foods by nutrient contribution. SETTING: The study took place in six remote communities along the lower Cenepa River in the Amazonas District of Peru, South America. SUBJECTS: Dietary data were collected from 49 Awajún mothers and 34 children aged 3-6 years, representative of the six communities. RESULTS: Higher traditional food diversity was associated with greater protein, fibre, vitamin and mineral intakes when controlling for energy (partial correlations = 0.37 to 0.64). Unique sources for iron, total vitamin A and vitamin C were found in the Awajún traditional food system. CONCLUSIONS: A traditional food diversity score was a useful tool for predicting nutrient adequacy for the Awajún. Promotion of the Awajún traditional food system should focus on dietary diversity and unique nutrient-dense local foods.
17611131	Nociceptor sensitization to mechanical and thermal stimuli in pig skin in vivo.	Primary hyperalgesia to mechanical and thermal stimuli are major clinical symptoms of inflammatory pain and can be induced experimentally by ultraviolet-B (UV-B) irradiation in humans. We set-up a pig model in order to have more options for pharmacological intervention on primary hyperalgesia. Pig skin was irradiated with a dose one- to threefold higher than the minimum erythema dose (MED) and investigated for mechanical and heat responsiveness 24 and 48 h post UV-B treatment. C-fiber activation upon mechanical and thermal stimulation was assessed indirectly by extent of the axon reflex erythema (flare) measured by laser Doppler imaging. Mechanical stimulation with von Frey filaments (100 mN) induced flare responses in UV-B treated skin at 24 and 48 h, but no effect was measured in normal untreated skin. Increased mechanical stimulation (600 mN) elicited a small flare response in normal skin in an area of 1.8 cm(2) on average that was extending about 2.5 cm(2) in the UV-B irradiated sites. Thermal stimuli provoked in normal pig skin flare areas of approximately 2 cm(2) (45 degrees C, 10 s) and 4.5 cm(2) (47 degrees C, 10 s) which increased to about 3.5 cm(2) (45 degrees C) and 5.5 cm(2) (47 degrees C) following UV-B irradiation at 24 and 48 h. No significant differences of mechanically or thermally induced hypersensitivity were seen between 24 and 48 h after irradiation. We conclude that UV-B induced mechanical and heat sensitization of primary afferent nociceptors can be assessed in pig skin, providing a new human-like model of primary hyperalgesia. Sensitization of primarily mechano-insensitive (silent) nociceptors, which are underlying the flare response in humans, most probably contributes to the observation presented here.
17614164	Synthesis, computational study and cytotoxic activity of new 4-hydroxycoumarin derivatives.	Six new 4-hydroxycoumarin derivatives have been synthesized. They were characterized by UV-vis, IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, mass spectral data, elemental analysis, TLC and melting point determination. The new 4-hydroxycoumarin derivatives are studied by computational methods--DFT (B3LYP) and force field methods (MM2 and OPLS), in order to optimize their geometry and calculate quantum-chemical properties and conformational analysis. Five new 4-hydroxycoumarin derivatives were tested for cytotoxic activity in two tumor cell lines--HL-60 and EJ. The obtained results are compared with the utilized anticancer drug melphalan. Two of these compounds--ethyl 2-[(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)(4-hydroxy-2-oxo-2H-chromen-3-yl)methyl]-3-oxobutanoate (SS-16) and ethyl 2-[(4-hydroxy-2-oxo-2H-chromen-3-yl)(3-nitrophenyl)methyl]-3-oxobutanoate (SS-21) show comparatively good cytotoxic properties. Their activity is weaker than melphalan. SS-16 seems to be more active than SS-21.
17614247	Electrochemotherapy in treatment of tumours.	AIM: Electrochemotherapy is a local drug delivery approach aimed at treatment with palliative intent of cutaneous and subcutaneous tumour nodules of different histologies. Electrochemotherapy, via cell membrane permeabilising electric pulses, potentiates the cytotoxicity of non-permeant or poorly permeant anticancer drugs with high intrinsic cytotoxicity, such as bleomycin or cisplatin, at the site of electric pulse application. METHODS: An overview of preclinical and clinical studies is presented, and the treatment procedure is further critically evaluated. RESULTS: In clinical studies electrochemotherapy has proved to be a highly efficient and safe approach for treating cutaneous and subcutaneous tumour nodules. The treatment response for various tumours (predominantly melanoma) was approximately 75% complete and 10% partial response of the treated nodules. CONCLUSIONS: Electrochemotherapy is a new, clinically acknowledged method for the treatment of cutaneous and subcutaneous tumours. Its advantages are high effectiveness on tumours with different histologies, simple application, minimal side effects and the possibility of effective repetitive treatment.
17615248	Neuroanatomical correlates of fluid intelligence in healthy adults and persons with vascular risk factors.	The main objective of this study was to examine the effects of regional brain changes on cognitive decline and the modifying influence of vascular risk (VR) factors. We present latent difference score analyses of associations among 5-year changes in 12 regional brain volumes and age-sensitive cognitive functions in 87 adults (32 with identifiable VR factors). We found reliable individual differences in volume change for 11 of the 12 brain regions but not in the cognitive measures that showed average longitudinal decline. Thus, associations between rates of change in fluid intelligence and brain volumes could not be assessed. We observed, however, that lower levels of fluid intelligence were associated with smaller prefrontal and hippocampal volumes. Lower fluid intelligence scores were also linked to greater longitudinal shrinkage of the entorhinal cortex (EC). After accounting for the effects of age, sex, and VR factors, the orbitofrontal cortex and the prefrontal white matter (PFw) volumes as well as the 5-year change in the EC volume predicted fluid intelligence level. VR was independently associated with smaller prefrontal volumes and lower fluid intelligence. Thus, prefrontal and medial-temporal systems may play different roles in age-related differences and changes in cognitive performance.
17619132	Is the linguistic content of speech less salient than its perceptual features in autism?	Open-ended tasks are rarely used to investigate cognition in autism. No known studies have directly examined whether increased attention to the perceptual level of speech in autism might contribute to a reduced tendency to process language meaningfully. The present study investigated linguistic versus perceptual speech processing preferences. Children with autism and controls were tested on a quasi-open-format paradigm, in which speech stimuli contained competing linguistic and perceptual information, and could be processed at either level. Relative to controls, children with autism exhibited superior perceptual processing of speech. However, whilst their tendency to preferentially process linguistic rather than perceptual information was weaker than that of controls, it was nevertheless their primary processing mode. Implications for language acquisition in autism are discussed.
17619142	Mothers' and fathers' attributions and beliefs in families of girls and boys with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.	This study examined parent and child gender effects on parents' attributions and beliefs in regards to child symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Participants included mothers and fathers of 19 girls and 17 boys with ADHD. Groups of boys and girls, aged 5-13 years, were equated on age and medication status, as well as ADHD symptom severity. These groups also were similar in the severity of comorbid oppositional behaviors and internalizing problems, as well as a variety of demographic characteristics. Parents' attributions for child behavior were assessed in response to written scenarios describing either hyperactive/impulsive or inattentive symptoms of ADHD. Parents also completed a questionnaire assessing beliefs and knowledge about ADHD. There were no child gender effects for parents' attributions or beliefs. All parents attributed inattentive symptoms to more internal, global and stable causes than impulsive symptoms. Mothers attributed both inattentive and impulsive child symptoms to more global and stable causes than did fathers. Fathers, but not mothers, reported more negative reactions to ADHD symptoms that were perceived as having an internal cause. Finally, mothers scored higher on beliefs in behavior management than did fathers, and fathers believed more in psychological causes and treatments for ADHD. Possible explanations for and implications of these results are explored.
17619212	Comparison of rhizosphere bacterial communities in Arabidopsis thaliana mutants for systemic acquired resistance.	Systemic acquired resistance (SAR) is an inducible systemic plant defense against a broad spectrum of plant pathogens, with the potential to secrete antimicrobial compounds into the soil. However, its impact on rhizosphere bacteria is not known. In this study, we examined fingerprints of bacterial communities in the rhizosphere of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana to determine the effect of SAR on bacterial community structure and diversity. We compared Arabidopsis mutants that are constitutive and non-inducible for SAR and verified SAR activation by measuring pathogenesis-related protein activity via a beta-glucoronidase (GUS) reporter construct driven by the beta-1-3 glucanase promoter. We used terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis of MspI- and HaeIII-digested 16S rDNA to estimate bacterial rhizosphere community diversity, with Lactobacillus sp. added as internal controls. T-RFLP analysis showed a clear rhizosphere effect on community structure, and diversity analysis of both rhizosphere and bulk soil operational taxonomic units (as defined by terminal restriction fragments) using richness, Shannon-Weiner, and Simpson's diversity indices and evenness confirmed that the presence of Arabidopsis roots significantly altered bacterial communities. This effect of altered soil microbial community structure by plants was also seen upon multivariate cluster analysis of the terminal restriction fragments. We also found visible differences in the rhizosphere community fingerprints of different Arabidopsis SAR mutants; however, there was no clear decrease of rhizosphere diversity because of constitutive SAR expression. Our study suggests that SAR can alter rhizosphere bacterial communities, opening the door to further understanding and application of inducible plant defense as a driving force in structuring soil bacterial assemblages.
17624439	Infants' visual anticipation of object structure in grasp planning.	The coordination between visual and manual domains is a cornerstone of learning in early development. If infants anticipate an object's physical characteristics prior to contact (i.e., from visual inspection), they could learn more about the physical world through visual observation only than if manual exploration is required. In this experiment, infants grasped a series of four round balls quite similar in size and overall shape, but different in structure. Two were composed of solid hard plastic (one transparent, one opaque) in a rigid structure, and two were composed of more flexible plastic in a nonrigid structure. This nonrigid structure afforded grasping using a precision grasp with fingertips extending inside the ball's outer edge. In contrast, the rigid balls could be grasped only by a full-hand power grasp (due to the relative sizes of ball and infants' hands). The infants' manual anticipations were assessed in their first reach for each ball, prior to their first contact with the ball. In addition, grasping and other exploratory behaviors were assessed after contact with the ball. Results from this study suggest that infants from 5 to 15 months of age incorporate visible information about an object's structure into their action on the object. This provides evidence that visuomotor connections are present as soon as infants start reaching for objects, allowing them to select the appropriate grasp for an object's structure, even if they are not always capable of executing a pickup of the object using this grasp. Further research should investigate the discrepancies between infants' grasp planning and their grasp execution.
17624487	The diversity of bacterial communities associated with Atlantic cod Gadus morhua.	The spatial and temporal changes in the bacterial communities associated with the Atlantic cod Gadus morhua were investigated using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis of 16S recombinant DNA (rDNA). Epidermal mucous was sampled from 366 cod caught in three harvest locations (Baltic, Icelandic, and North Seas) over three seasons (spring 2002, autumn 2002, and spring 2003), and an automated method for the high-throughput processing of environmental samples was developed using a Qiagen BioRobot. The analysis revealed that a diverse consortium of bacteria were found on fish; gamma-proteobacteria and Cytophaga-Flavobacter-Bacteroides (CFB) species were dominant. T-RFLP peak profiles suggested that operational taxonomic units (OTUs) related to Photobacterium sp., Psychrobacter sp., and Bacteroides sp. were common to all sites in all three seasons, but there were intersite variations in community composition. Cod caught from different seas had distinct reproducible bacterial assemblages. Whereas communities from fish caught in the Baltic and Icelandic Seas were relatively stable over the three seasons, those from fish from the North Sea changed significantly over time.
17624498	Comparison of karyotypes of Acipenser oxyrinchus and A. sturio by chromosome banding and fluorescent in situ hybridization.	A highly debated problem in Acipenseridae taxonomy is whether Acipenser oxyrinchus (North American Atlantic sturgeon) and A. sturio (European Atlantic sturgeon) are true species: a detailed comparison of their karyotypes could provide relevant information. Here we describe for the first time the karyotype of A. oxyrinchus (2n = 121 +/- 3), and its features, among which the constitutive heterochromatin, revealed by C-banding technique, the distribution of telomeric regions, and the 5S rRNA genes, detected by FISH. The results reveal that A. oxyrinchus and A. sturio karyotypes and features are quite similar. Moreover, comparing the results obtained through hybridization by FISH with HindIII and PstI satellite DNA in these and in other sturgeon species, no hybridization signals are detected in A. sturio and A. oxyrinchus, while A. stellatus and A. gueldenstaedtii show hybridization. Thus A. sturio and A. oxyrinchus appear very similar from a cytogenetic point of view: these and molecular data repeatedly point out that A. sturio and A. oxyrinchus represent a sister clade in comparison to all other sturgeon species up to now studied.
17625593	Activation of proteinase-activated receptor-2 by human kallikrein-related peptidases.	Proteinase-activated receptor-2 (PAR2) is a seven transmembrane spanning, G-protein-coupled receptor, present on the membrane of many cell types including keratinocytes. In skin, PAR2 is suggested to play a regulatory role during inflammation, epidermal barrier function, and pruritus. PAR2 is activated by trypsin-like proteases by a unique mechanism where cleavage of the receptor leads to the release of a small peptide, which activates the receptor as a tethered ligand. The endogenous activators of PAR2 on keratinocytes have not been identified as of yet. Potential candidates are kallikrein-related peptidases (KLKs) expressed by epidermal cells. Therefore, the ability of four human skin-derived KLKs was examined with regard to their capacity to activate PAR2 in vitro. PAR2 cleavage was followed by immunofluorescence analysis and functional activation by measurements of changes in intracellular calcium levels. We found that KLK5 and KLK14, but neither KLK7 nor KLK8, induced PAR2 signalling. We conclude that certain, but not all, epidermal KLKs are capable of activating PAR2. We could also show the coexpression of KLK14 and PAR2 receptor in inflammatory skin disorders. These in vitro results suggest that KLKs may take part in PAR2 activation in the epidermis and thereby in PAR2-mediated inflammatory responses, including epidermal barrier repair and pruritus. The role of KLKs in PAR2 activation in vivo remains to be elucidated.
17628747	Gamma knife radiosurgery for brainstem metastases: the UCSF experience.	PURPOSE: To assess clinical and imaging outcomes in patients treated with Gamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for brainstem metastases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed all patients with brain metastases treated with SRS at the University of California, San Francisco from 1991-2005 to identify patients who had SRS to a brainstem metastasis. Survival time and freedom from progression (FFP) were calculated from date of SRS using the Kaplan-Meier method. Prognostic factors were evaluated using the log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: From 1991 through 2005, 42 consecutive patients with brainstem metastases had SRS to 44 lesions (seven midbrain, 31 pontine, and six medullary) in 42 sessions. Primary diagnoses included 14 cases of lung cancer (one small-cell), 10 melanoma, 12 breast cancer, five renal cell, and one unknown. The median age was 55 years (range, 25-79). The median survival time was 9 months after SRS. Longer survival time was associated with single metastasis, non-melanoma histology, and extracranial disease control. The median target volume was 0.26 ml (0.015-2.8 ml) and the median prescribed dose was 16.0 Gy (10.0-19.8 Gy). Brainstem lesion FFP was 90% at 6 months and 77% at 1 year. Four patients had brainstem complications following treatment. Poor brainstem outcome was associated with melanoma and renal cell histology as well as brainstem lesion volume > or =1 ml. CONCLUSIONS: In this series, SRS using a median dose of 16 Gy provided excellent local control with relatively low morbidity in patients with brainstem metastases less than 1 ml or non-melanoma, non-renal cell histology.
17629478	Lipase-catalyzed biodiesel production from waste activated bleaching earth as raw material in a pilot plant.	The production of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) from waste activated bleaching earth (ABE) discarded by the crude oil refining industry using lipase from Candida cylindracea was investigated in a 50-L pilot plant. Diesel oil or kerosene was used as an organic solvent for the transesterification of triglycerides embedded in the waste ABE. When 1% (w/w) lipase was added to waste ABE, the FAME content reached 97% (w/w) after reaction for 12 h at 25 degrees C with an agitation rate of 30 rpm. The FAME production rate was strongly dependent upon the amount of enzyme added. Mixtures of FAME and diesel oil at ratios of 45:55 (BDF-45) and 35:65 (BDF-35) were assessed and compared with the European specifications for biodiesel as automotive diesel fuel, as defined by pr EN 14214. The biodiesel quality of BDF-45 met the EN 14214 standard. BDF-45 was used as generator fuel, and the exhaust emissions were compared with those of diesel oil. The CO and SO2 contents were reduced, but nitrogen oxide emission increased by 10%. This is the first report of a pilot plant study of lipase-catalyzed FAME production using waste ABE as a raw material. This result demonstrates a promising reutilization method for the production of FAME from industrial waste resources containing vegetable oils for use as a biodiesel fuel.
17631653	The "eyespot module" and eyespots as modules: development, evolution, and integration of a complex phenotype.	Organisms are inherently modular, yet modules also evolve in response to selection for functional integration or functional specialization of traits. For serially repeated homologous traits, there is a clear expectation that selection on the function of individual traits will reduce the integration between traits and subdivide a single ancestral module. The eyespots on butterfly wings are one example of serially repeated morphological traits that share a common developmental mechanism but are subject to natural and sexual selection for divergent functions. Here, I test two hypotheses about the organization of the eyespot pattern into independent dorsal-ventral and anterior-posterior modules, using a graphical modeling technique to examine patterns of eyespot covariation among and within wing surfaces in the butterfly Bicyclus anynana. Although there is a hierarchical and complex pattern of integration among eyespots, the results show a surprising mismatch between patterns of eyespot integration and the developmental and evolutionary eyespot units identified in previous empirical studies. These results are discussed in light of the relationships between developmental, functional, and evolutionary modules, and they suggest that developmental sources of independent trait variation are often masked by developmental sources of trait integration.
17634073	Three-dimensional epidermis-like growth of human mesenchymal stem cells on dermal equivalents: contribution to tissue organization by adaptation of myofibroblastic phenotype and function.	Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) are able to differentiate into mature cells of various mesenchymal tissues. Recent studies have reported that hMSC may even give rise to cells of ectodermal origin. This indication of plasticity makes hMSC a promising donor source for cell-based therapies. This study explores the differentiation potential of hMSC in a tissue-specific microenvironment simulated in vitro. HMSC were cultured air-exposed on dermal equivalents (DEs) consisting of collagen types I and III with dermal fibroblasts and subjected to conditions similar to those used for tissue engineering of skin with keratinocytes. Culture conditions were additionally modified by pre-treating the cells with 5-azacytidine or supplementing the medium with all trans retinoic acid (RA). HMSC were capable of adaptation to epidermis-specific conditions without losing their mesenchymal multipotency. However, despite the viability and evident three-dimensional epidermis-like growth pattern, hMSC showed a persistent expression of mesenchymal but not of epithelial markers, thus indicating a lack of epidermal (trans) differentiation. Further, electron microscopy and immunohistochemical analyses demonstrated that hMSC cultured under epidermis-specific conditions adopted a myofibroblastic phenotype and function, promoted in particular by air exposure. In conclusion, multipotent hMSC failed to differentiate into E-cadherin- or cytokeratin-expressing cells under optimized organotypic culture conditions for keratinocytes but differentiated into myofibroblast-like cells contracting the extracellular matrix, a phenomenon that was enhanced by RA and 5-azacytidine. These results indicate that hMSC might contribute to wound-healing processes by extracellular matrix reorganization and wound contraction but not by differentiation into keratinocytes.
17636397	Genetic polymorphisms in the vascular endothelial growth factor gene and breast cancer risk. The Austrian "tumor of breast tissue: incidence, genetics, and environmental risk factors" study.	PURPOSE: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a key regulator of tumor-induced angiogenesis and is required for growth of tumors. We tested the hypothesis that VEGF gene polymorphisms may be associated with breast cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We performed a case-control study including 804 female incident breast cancer patients and 804 female age-matched healthy control subjects. We selected seven VEGF candidate polymorphisms and determined genotypes by 5'-nuclease (TaqMan) assays. Furthermore, VEGF plasma levels and genotypes were analyzed in a group of 81 healthy volunteers (64 men and 17 women). RESULTS: Haplotype analysis showed two separate blocks of high-linkage disequilibrium, formed by five polymorphisms upstream of the coding sequence (promoter and 5' untranslated region) and two polymorphisms downstream of the coding sequence. None of the single polymorphisms or haplotypes was significantly associated with the presence of breast cancer. After Bonferroni correction for multiple testing, only one statistical signifcant association between VEGF genotypes and haplotypes and tumor characteristics was observed (-634C allele and small tumor size; p < 0.001). In a multivariate regression analysis including sex, age, VEGF genotypes, and haplotypes as covariates and VEGF plasma level as dependent variable, none of the VEGF polymorphism or haplotypes was a significant predictor of VEGF plasma levels. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings do not support the hypothesis that VEGF polymorphisms are associated with breast cancer risk. The association of the VEGF -634C allele with small tumor size is in clear contrast to a previous publication and should be interpreted with caution until replicated by additional studies.
17636560	Posterior cingulate activation during moral dilemma in adolescents.	Neuroimaging research examining correlates of adolescent behavioral maturation has focused largely on issues related to higher cognitive development. Currently few studies have explored neural correlates of emotional reactivity in adolescent groups. In this study, we sought to examine the nature of posterior cingulate activation during situations of moral dilemma in normal adolescents. We focused on this region because of emerging evidence that suggests its role in emotionally self-relevant mental processing. Ten healthy teenagers, aged from 14 to 16 years, underwent three fMRI sequences designed to examine (i) brain responses during moral dilemma; (ii) brain responses during passive viewing of the moral dilemma outcome; and (iii); "deactivation" during a simple cognitive task compared with resting-state activity. Our main finding was that during moral dilemma, all subjects showed significant activation of the posterior cingulate cortex, and more variable activation of the medial frontal cortex and angular gyrus. Interestingly, these findings were replicated in each subject using the passive viewing task, suggesting that the previous pattern was not specific to moral reasoning or decision making. Finally, six of the ten subjects showed deactivation of the same posterior cingulate region during the cognitive task, indicating some commonality of function between posterior cingulate activity during moral dilemmas and rest. We propose that these posterior cingulate changes may relate to basic neuronal activities associated with processing self-relevant emotional stimuli. Given the high single-subject reproducibility of posterior cingulate activations, our findings may contribute to further characterize adolescent emotional reactivity in developmental neuroimaging studies.
17637703	Maternal employment and early childhood overweight: findings from the UK Millennium Cohort Study.	BACKGROUND: In most developed countries, maternal employment has increased rapidly. Changing patterns of family life have been suggested to be contributing to the rising prevalence of childhood obesity. OBJECTIVES: Our primary objective was to examine the relationship between maternal and partner employment and overweight in children aged 3 years. Our secondary objective was to investigate factors related to early childhood overweight only among mothers in employment. DESIGN: Cohort study. SUBJECTS: A total of 13 113 singleton children aged 3 years in the Millennium Cohort Study, born between 2000 and 2002 in the United Kingdom, who had complete height/weight data and parental employment histories. MEASUREMENTS: Parents were interviewed when the child was aged 9 months and 3 years, and the child's height and weight were measured at 3 years. Overweight (including obesity) was defined by the International Obesity Task Force cut-offs. RESULTS: A total of 23% (3085) of children were overweight at 3 years. Any maternal employment after the child's birth was associated with early childhood overweight (odds ratio (OR) [95% confidence interval (CI)]; 1.14 [1.00, 1.29]), after adjustment for potential confounding and mediating factors. Children were more likely to be overweight for every 10 h a mother worked per week (OR [95% CI]; 1.10 [1.04, 1.17]), after adjustment. An interaction with household income revealed that this relationship was only significant for children from households with an annual income of pound33 000 ($57 750) or higher. There was no evidence for an association between early childhood overweight and whether or for how many hours the partner worked, or with mothers' or partners' duration of employment. These relationships were also evident among mothers in employment. Independent risk factors for early childhood overweight were consistent with the published literature. CONCLUSIONS: Long hours of maternal employment, rather than lack of money may impede young children's access to healthy foods and physical activity. Policies supporting work-life balance may help parents reduce potential barriers.
17637740	Cytotoxic drug-induced, p53-mediated upregulation of caspase-8 in tumor cells.	Apoptosis resistance is crucially involved in cancer development and progression, represents the leading cause for failure of anticancer therapy and is caused, for example, by downregulation of proapoptotic intracellular signaling molecules such as caspase-8. We found that the cytotoxic drugs methotrexate (MTX) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) were both able to sensitize resistant tumor cells for induction of apoptosis by p53-mediated upregulation of caspase-8. Increase in caspase-8 messenger RNA and protein expression disabled tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced proliferation and restored sensitivity toward TRAIL-induced apoptosis which was inhibited by transfection of p53 decoy oligonucleotides, p53 shRNA and caspase-8 shRNA. Upregulation of caspase-8 and sensitization toward TRAIL-induced apoptosis was found both in a broad panel of tumor cell lines with downregulated caspase-8 and in TRAIL-resistant primary tumor cells of children with acute leukemia. Taken together, we have identified caspase-8 as an important p53 target gene regulated by cytotoxic drugs. These findings highlight a new drug-induced modulation of physiological apoptosis pathways, which may be involved in successful anticancer therapy using MTX and 5-FU in leukemia and solid tumors over decades.
17637743	Fibroblast growth factor-2 mediates transforming growth factor-beta action in prostate cancer reactive stroma.	Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is overexpressed at sites of wound repair and in most adenocarcinomas including prostate cancer. In stromal tissues, TGF-beta regulates cell proliferation, phenotype and matrix synthesis. To address mechanisms of TGF-beta action in cancer-associated reactive stroma, we developed prostate stromal cells null for TGF-beta receptor II (TbetaRII) or engineered to express a dominant-negative Smad3 to attenuate TGF-beta signaling. The differential reactive stroma (DRS) xenograft model was used to evaluate altered stromal TGF-beta signaling on LNCaP tumor progression. LNCaP xenograft tumors constructed with TbetaRII null or dominant-negative Smad3 stromal cells exhibited a significant reduction in mass and microvessel density relative to controls. Additionally, decreased cellular fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) immunostaining was associated with attenuated TGF-beta signaling in stroma. In vitro, TGF-beta stimulated stromal FGF-2 expression and release. However, stromal cells with attenuated TGF-beta signaling were refractory to TGF-beta-stimulated FGF-2 expression and release. Re-expression of FGF-2 in these stromal cells in DRS xenografts resulted in restored tumor mass and microvessel density. In summary, these data show that TGF-beta signaling in reactive stroma is angiogenic and tumor promoting and that this effect is mediated in part through a TbetaRII/Smad3-dependent upregulation of FGF-2 expression and release.
17640280	Two outbreaks of Burkholderia cepacia nosocomial infection in a neonatal intensive care unit.	BACKGROUND: An outbreak of Burkholderia cepacia septicaemia occurred in our neonatal unit over a 9-week period in 2001, affecting 23 babies and two died. A second outbreak lasting 8 days occurred a year later, affecting five babies. SETTING: Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Kuala Terengganu Hospital. AIM: To review the patient characteristics and the risk factors for septicaemia in the first outbreak. METHODS: Retrospective review of records and in the first outbreak a case-control analysis with 23 matched controls for risk factors for septicaemia. RESULTS: In the first outbreak, median birthweight was 1670 g (range 860-3760) and median gestational age was 32 weeks (range 27-41). There were 32 episodes of septicaemia, and five and two patients had two and three episodes, respectively. The mortality rate was 6.3% per septicaemic episode. Multiple logistic regression showed the presence of a prior long line was associated with first septicaemic episode (OR 7.07, 95% CI 1.37-36.47 with P = 0.019) but not prior assisted ventilation. The organism was isolated from the water of an oxygen humidifier in the delivery room, three ventilator water traps and one humidifier water trap in the neonatal unit. In the second outbreak, six episodes of septicaemia occurred in five neonates with median birthweight 2060 g and median gestational age 32.5 weeks. The organism was isolated from two ventilator water traps. CONCLUSION: These two outbreaks of Burkholderia cepacia subsided with general infection control measures. The sources of these two outbreaks were not identified.
17640830	Prefrontal cortex modulation using transcranial DC stimulation reduces alcohol craving: a double-blind, sham-controlled study.	BACKGROUND: Functional neuroimaging studies have shown that specific brain areas are associated with alcohol craving including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). We tested whether modulation of DLPFC using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) could alter alcohol craving in patients with alcohol dependence while being exposed to alcohol cues. METHODS: We performed a randomized sham-controlled study in which 13 subjects received sham and active bilateral tDCS delivered to DLPFC (anodal left/cathodal right and anodal right/cathodal left). For sham stimulation, the electrodes were placed at the same positions as in active stimulation; however, the stimulator was turned off after 30s of stimulation. Subjects were presented videos depicting alcohol consumption to increase alcohol craving. RESULTS: Our results showed that both anodal left/cathodal right and anodal right/cathodal left significantly decreased alcohol craving compared to sham stimulation (p<0.0001). In addition, we found that following treatment, craving could not be further increased by alcohol cues. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings showed that tDCS treatment to DLPFC can reduce alcohol craving. These findings extend the results of previous studies using noninvasive brain stimulation to reduce craving in humans. Given the relatively rapid suppressive effect of tDCS and the highly fluctuating nature of alcohol craving, this technique may prove to be a valuable treatment strategy within the clinical setting.
17644337	The control of upright stance in young, elderly and persons with Parkinson's disease.	The aims of the present study are twofold: (1) to compare the postural control mechanisms of young and elderly people as well as in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients during quiet standing and (2) to assess the impact of a stooped posture on these mechanisms. All subjects were required to maintain both a side-by-side and a 45 degrees foot position. Elderly subjects performed a third condition where they were requested to mimic the stooped posture as adopted by PD subjects. The net centre of pressure (COP(net)) and centre of mass (COM) profiles in the anterior/posterior (A/P) and medial/lateral (M/L) planes were analyzed. The COP(net) signal was recorded from two force plates and was categorized in two mechanisms: an ankle mechanism (COP(c)) and a load/unload hip mechanism (COP(v)). The results showed similar postural control mechanisms in young, elderly and PD subjects. When the feet were side-by-side, the COP(net) was controlled by the ankle plantar/dorsiflexors (COP(c)) in the A/P direction, while by the hip abductor/adductors (COP(v)) controlled in the M/L direction. When the feet were in the 45 degrees position, both the ankle and hip mechanisms contributed to the COP(net). However, the PD subjects showed significant smaller RMS amplitudes compared to the elderly people in the 45 degrees foot position and in the stooped posture. These findings suggest that PD subjects resort to a stiffening strategy to control their balance in postural tasks that imply a mixed control (ankle and hip mechanisms) but have adapted to their stooped posture.
17646064	Effect of reactive oxygen species on capacitation and associated protein tyrosine phosphorylation in buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) spermatozoa.	In the present study, the effect of two particular reactive oxygen species (ROS), superoxide anion (O(2)(-)) and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) on buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) sperm capacitation and associated protein tyrosine phosphorylation was studied. Ejaculated buffalo spermatozoa were suspended in sp-TALP medium at 50 x 10(6)/mL and incubated at 38.5 degrees C for 6h with or without heparin (10(g/mL; a positive control), or xanthine (X; 0.5mM)-xanthine oxidase (XO; 0.05 U/mL)-catalase (C; 2100 U/mL) system that generates O(2)(-) or NADPH (5mM) that stimulates the endogenous O(2)(-) production or H(2)O(2) (50 microM). The specific effect of O(2)(-), H(2)O(2) and NADPH on buffalo sperm capacitation and protein tyrosine phosphorylation was assessed by the addition of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase and diphenylene iodonium (DPI), respectively, to the incubation medium. Each of X+XO+C system, NADPH and H(2)O(2) induced a significantly higher percentage (P<0.05) of capacitation in buffalo spermatozoa compared to control. However, DPI inhibited this NADPH-induced capacitation and protein tyrosine phosphorylation and suggested for existence of an oxidase in buffalo spermatozoa. Using immunoblotting technique, at least seven tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (20, 32, 38, 45, 49, 78 and 95 kDa) were detected in capacitated buffalo spermatozoa. Out of these, the tyrosine phosphorylation of p95 was induced extensively by both O(2)(-) as well as exogenous source of H(2)O(2) and using specific activators and inhibitors of signaling pathways, it was found this induction was regulated through a cAMP-dependent PKA pathway. Further, immunofluorescent localization study revealed that these ROS-induced tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins are mostly distributed in the midpiece and principal piece regions of the flagellum of capacitated spermatozoa and suggested for increased molecular activity in flagellum during capacitation. Thus, the study revealed that both O(2)(-) and H(2)O(2) promote capacitation and associated protein tyrosine phosphorylation in buffalo spermatozoa and unlike human and bovine, a different subset of sperm proteins were tyrosine-phosphorylated during heparin- and ROS-induced capacitation and regulation of these ROS-induced processes were mediated through a cAMP/PKA signaling pathway.
17647088	Phylogenetic diversity of culturable fungi associated with the Hawaiian Sponges Suberites zeteki and Gelliodes fibrosa.	Sponges are well documented to harbor large amounts of microbes. Both culture-dependent and molecular approaches have revealed remarkable bacterial diversity in marine sponges. Fungi are commonly isolated from marine sponges, yet no reports on phylogenetic diversity of sponge-inhabiting fungi exist. In this report, we investigated the phylogenetic diversity of culturable fungi from the Hawaiian alien marine sponges Suberites zeteki and Gelliodes fibrosa. A total of 44 independent isolates were recovered from these two sponge species, representing 7 orders and 22 genera of Ascomycota. The majority (58%) of fungal isolates from S. zeteki resided in the Pleosporales group, while the predominant isolates (52%) from G. fibrosa were members of the Hypocreales group. Though differing in fungal species composition and structure, culturable communities of these two sponges displayed similar phylogenetic diversity. At the genus level, only two genera Penicillium and Trichoderma in the Eurotiales and Hypocreales orders, respectively, were present in both sponge species. The other genera of the fungal isolates were associated with either S. zeteki or G. fibrosa. Some of these fungal genera had been isolated from sponges collected in other marine habitats, but more than half of these genera were identified for the first time in these two marine sponges. Overall, the diversity of culturable fungal communities from these two sponge species is much higher than that observed in studies of marine sponges from other areas. This is the first report of phylogenetic diversity of marine sponge-associated fungi and adds one more dimension to our current understanding of the phylogenetic diversity of sponge-symbiotic microbes.
17647224	Delivery of rapamycin by PLGA nanoparticles enhances its suppressive activity on dendritic cells.	The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of rapamycin delivery by poly (D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles on the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs). DCs were generated from mouse bone marrow and exposed to particulate and soluble rapamycin without any additional treatment, or with pre- or posttreatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Annexin V-FITC/PI staining was performed on DC cultures to assess the viability of DCs during study. Surface phenotype of DCs was characterized for the expression of maturation markers, that is, MHC class II, CD86, and CD40 by flow cytometry. Cell culture supernatants were analyzed for the production of TGF-beta, IL-12, and IL-10 cytokines using sandwich ELISA method. DCs from Balb/C mice were cocultured with T cells from C57BL/6 mice and allogenic mixed lymphocyte reaction was assessed by [3H]-Thymidine incorporation. Unlike free rapamycin that has shown little if any effect on the expression of maturation markers in immature DCs, PLGA encapsulated rapamycin decreased the expression of all maturation markers under the study, that is, MHC class II, CD86, and CD40, significantly. LPS pre- or posttreated DCs demonstrated decreased expression of MHC class II, CD86, and CD40 in the presence of soluble or encapsulated rapamycin. The cytokine secretion profiles revealed high levels of TGF-beta and very low levels of IL-10 and IL-12 production. Rapamycin in soluble or encapsulated form significantly inhibited mixed lymphocyte reaction in DCs. The inhibitory effect of rapamycin on the maturation of DCs with respect to DC phenotype, cytokine production, and functional effects on the proliferation of T cells was significantly increased by PLGA delivery.
17651397	Polymorphisms in CYP1A1 gene are associated with male infertility in a Chinese population.	Cytochrome P4501A1 (CYP1A1) is a key enzyme in phase I bioactivation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which have potential reproductive toxicity. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of the CYP1A1 polymorphisms with male infertility in a Han-Chinese population. We genotyped two polymorphisms, CYP1A1*2A and CYP1A1*2C, using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay in a hospital-based case-control study including 192 infertile patients with non-obstructive azoospermia or severe oligozoospermia and 226 fertile controls. We found that the genotype distribution of CYP1A1*2C was significantly different between the patients and the controls (p = 0.019). Analysis showed that CYP1A1*2C AG genotype was associated with a significantly decreased risk of male infertility [odds ratio (OR) = 0.56, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 0.36-0.86, p = 0.005] compared with the AA genotype. A statistically significantly decreased risk of male infertility was found to be associated with the CYP1A1*2C AG genotype plus GG genotype compared with CYP1A1*2C AA genotype (OR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.40-0.91, p = 0.011). No significant association was detected between CYP1A1*2A polymorphism and male infertility. Haplotypic analysis showed a significantly increased risk of male infertility associated with the C-A haplotype compared with the T-A haplotype (OR = 1.98, 95% CI = 1.27-3.09), indicating a synergic effect of the two polymorphisms. Our results suggest that the CYP1A1 polymorphisms may contribute to the pathogenesis of male infertility in the Han-Chinese population.
17651845	Exercise training in advanced heart failure patients: discordance between improved exercise tolerance and unchanged NT-proBNP levels.	BACKGROUND: Exercise training can improve aerobic capacity and symptoms in congestive heart failure (CHF) patients. AIMS: To test the feasibility of exercise training in advanced CHF patients, and examine the potential benefit from peripheral vascular and muscular conditioning as well as improved central hemodynamic and neurohumoral status. METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty NYHA functional class III, CHF patients (mean age 61+/-13 yr, ejection fraction 27+/-4%, VO2max 11.3+/-3.9 ml/kg/min) were enrolled. Exercise capacity, cardiovascular parameters and serum levels of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) were determined at baseline and after 18 weeks of moderate intensity exercise training. Twenty eight (93%) patients, who completed the exercise program, experienced marked improvements in the 6 min walk (+39%) and exercise duration on the modified Bruce protocol (+66%). Smaller improvements were recorded in the cardiac index (a 15% increase), in the maximal oxygen consumption (a 13% increase in VO2max), in the left ventricular ejection fraction (an 11% increase) and in the systemic vascular resistance and pulmonary artery pressure (an 11% decrease). NT-proBNP levels were not significantly affected. They correlated with exercise capacity and VO2max on baseline measurement, but these correlations were not found after training. CONCLUSION: Rehabilitation is feasible, even in advanced CHF, and leads to markedly improved exercise performance, but does not affect the level of the principal neurohumoral marker of prognosis - NT-proBNP. Resting cardiovascular performance and maximal oxygen consumption improve less than functional capacity, suggesting that an important benefit is derived from muscle conditioning and improved peripheral vascular response to exercise.
17652074	Agricultural sustainability: concepts, principles and evidence.	Concerns about sustainability in agricultural systems centre on the need to develop technologies and practices that do not have adverse effects on environmental goods and services, are accessible to and effective for farmers, and lead to improvements in food productivity. Despite great progress in agricultural productivity in the past half-century, with crop and livestock productivity strongly driven by increased use of fertilizers, irrigation water, agricultural machinery, pesticides and land, it would be over-optimistic to assume that these relationships will remain linear in the future. New approaches are needed that will integrate biological and ecological processes into food production, minimize the use of those non-renewable inputs that cause harm to the environment or to the health of farmers and consumers, make productive use of the knowledge and skills of farmers, so substituting human capital for costly external inputs, and make productive use of people's collective capacities to work together to solve common agricultural and natural resource problems, such as for pest, watershed, irrigation, forest and credit management. These principles help to build important capital assets for agricultural systems: natural; social; human; physical; and financial capital. Improving natural capital is a central aim, and dividends can come from making the best use of the genotypes of crops and animals and the ecological conditions under which they are grown or raised. Agricultural sustainability suggests a focus on both genotype improvements through the full range of modern biological approaches and improved understanding of the benefits of ecological and agronomic management, manipulation and redesign. The ecological management of agroecosystems that addresses energy flows, nutrient cycling, population-regulating mechanisms and system resilience can lead to the redesign of agriculture at a landscape scale. Sustainable agriculture outcomes can be positive for food productivity, reduced pesticide use and carbon balances. Significant challenges, however, remain to develop national and international policies to support the wider emergence of more sustainable forms of agricultural production across both industrialized and developing countries.
17652961	The phylogeography of African Brazilians.	BACKGROUND/AIMS: Approximately four million Africans were taken as slaves to Brazil, where they interbred extensively with Amerindians and Europeans. We have previously shown that while most White Brazilians carry Y chromosomes of European origin, they display high proportions of African and Amerindian mtDNA lineages, because of sex-biased genetic admixture. METHODS: We studied the Y chromosome and mtDNA haplogroup structure of 120 Black males from Sao Paulo, Brazil. RESULTS: Only 48% of the Y chromosomes, but 85% of the mtDNA haplogroups were characteristic of sub-Saharan Africa, confirming our previous observation of sexually biased mating. We mined literature data for mtDNA and Y chromosome haplogroup frequencies for African native populations from regions involved in Atlantic Slave Trade. Principal Components Analysis and Bayesian analysis of population structure revealed no genetic differentiation of Y chromosome marker frequencies between the African regions. However, mtDNA examination unraveled considerable genetic structure, with three clusters at Central-West Africa, West Africa and Southeast Africa. A hypothesis is proposed to explain this structure. CONCLUSION: Using these mtDNA data we could obtain for the first time an estimate of the relative ancestral contribution of Central-West (0.445), West (0.431) and Southeast Africa (0.123) to African Brazilians from Sao Paulo. These estimates are consistent with historical information.
17653090	The extracellular matrix protein ITIH5 is a novel prognostic marker in invasive node-negative breast cancer and its aberrant expression is caused by promoter hypermethylation.	Inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitors (ITIs) are protease inhibitors stabilizing the extracellular matrix. ITIs consist of one light (bikunin) and two heavy chains (ITIHs). We have recently characterized ITIH5, a novel member of the ITIH gene family, and showed that its messenger RNA is lost in a high proportion of breast tumours. In the present study, an ITIH5-specific polyclonal antibody was generated, validated with western blot and used for immunohistochemical analysis on a tissue microarray; ITIH5 was strongly expressed in epithelial cells of normal breast (n=11/15), while it was lost or strongly reduced in 42% (92/217) of invasive breast cancers. ITIH5 expression in invasive carcinomas was associated with positive expression of oestrogen receptor (P=0.008) and histological grade (P=0.024). Correlation of ITIH5 expression with clinical outcome revealed that patients with primary tumours retaining abundant ITIH5 expression had longer recurrence-free survival (RFS; P=0.037) and overall survival (OS; P=0.044), compared to those with reduced expression (mean RFS: 102 vs 78 months; mean OS: 120 vs 105 months). Methylation-specific PCR analysis frequently showed strong methylation of the ITIH5 promoter in primary breast tumours (41%, n=109) and breast cancer cell lines (n=6). Methylation was significantly associated with mRNA loss (P<0.001; n=39), and ITIH5 expression was induced after treatment of tumour cell lines with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Moreover, ITIH5 promoter methylation was significantly associated with reduced OS (P=0.008). The cellular function of ITIH5 was evaluated by forced expression of a full-length ITIH5 complementary DNA in the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231, which does not endogenously express ITIH5. ITIH5-expressing clones showed a 40% reduced proliferation rate compared to mock-transfected cells. Overall, these data show that promoter methylation-mediated loss of ITIH5 expression is associated with unfavourable outcome in breast cancer patients, and thus ITIH5 could be used as a prognostic marker, although this marker is not multivariate independent due to its close association with ER expression. Our data indicate that ITIH5 is a candidate class II tumour suppressor gene and could be involved in tumour progression, invasion and metastasis, as its absence is associated with increased proliferation rates and a prognostic value indicating poor clinical outcome.
17654515	Gap junctional intercellular communication is required to maintain embryonic stem cells in a non-differentiated and proliferative state.	Pluripotent embryonic stem (ES) cells are capable of maintaining a self-renewal state and have the potential to differentiate into derivatives of all three embryonic germ layers. Despite their importance in cell therapy and developmental biology, the mechanisms whereby ES cells remain in a proliferative and pluripotent state are still not fully understood. Here we establish a critical role of gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) and connexin43 (Cx43) in both processes. Pharmacological blockers of GJIC and Cx43 down-regulation by small interfering RNA (siRNA) caused a profound inhibitory effect on GJIC, as evidenced by experiments of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. This deficient intercellular communication in ES cells induced a loss of their pluripotent state, which was manifested in morphological changes, a decrease in alkaline phosphatase activity, Oct-3/4 and Nanog expression, as well as an up-regulation of several differentiation markers. A decrease in the proliferation rate was also detected. Under these conditions, the formation of embryoid bodies from mouse ES cells was impaired, although this inhibition was reversible upon restoration of GJIC. Our findings define a major function of GJIC in the regulation of self-renewal and maintenance of pluripotency in ES cells.
17654647	WebProp: Web interface for ab initio calculation of molecular one-electron properties.	This note describes the features and implementation issues of WebProp, a web-based interface for evaluating ab initio quality one-electron properties. The interface code is written in HTML and Python, while the backend is handled using Python and our indigenously developed code INDPROP for property evaluation. A novel feature of this setup is that it provides a simple interface for computing first principle one-electron properties of small to medium sized molecules. To facilitate computation of otherwise expensive calculations on large molecular systems, we employ the Molecular Tailoring Approach (MTA) developed in our laboratory to obtain the density matrix (DM). This DM is then employed for computing the one-electron properties of these systems. The backend transparently handles jobs submitted by the user and runs them either on a single machine or over a grid of compute nodes. The results of the calculations, which include the summary and the files necessary for visualization of one-electron properties, are e-mailed to the user. The user can either directly use the data or visualize it using visualization tools such as UNIVIS-2000 or Drishti.
17655274	Evaluating drug efficacy and toxicology in three dimensions: using synthetic extracellular matrices in drug discovery.	The acceptance of the new paradigm of 3-D cell culture is currently constrained by the lack of a biocompatible material in the marketplace that offers ease of use, experimental flexibility, and a seamless transition from in vitro to in vivo applications. I describe the development of a covalently cross-linked mimic of the extracellular matrix (sECM), now commercially available, for 3-D culture of cells in vitro and for translational use in vivo. These bio-inspired, biomimetic materials can be used "as is" in drug discovery, toxicology, cell banking, and, ultimately, medicine. For cell therapy and the development of clinical combination products, the sECM biomaterials must be highly reproducible, manufacturable, approvable, and affordable. To obtain integrated, functional, multicellular systems that recapitulate tissues and organs, the needs of the true end users, physicians and patients, must dictate the key design criteria. In chemical terms, the sECM consists of chemically-modified hyaluronan (HA), other glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), and ECM polypeptides containing thiol residues that are cross-linked using biocompatible polyvalent electrophiles. For example, co-cross-linking the semisynthetic thiol-modified HA-like GAG with thiol-modified gelatin produces Extracel as a hydrogel. This hydrogel may be formed in situ in the presence of cells or tissues to provide an injectable cell-delivery vehicle. Alternately, an Extracel hyrogel can be lyophilized to create a macroporous scaffold, which can then be employed for 3-D cell culture. In this Account, we describe four applications of sECMs that are relevant to the evaluation of drug efficacy and drug toxicity. First, the uses of sECMs to promote both in vitro and in vivo growth of healthy cellularized 3-D tissues are summarized. Primary or cell-line-derived cells, including fibroblasts, chondrocytes, hepatocytes, adult and embryonic stem cells, and endothelial and epithelial cells have been used. Second, primary hepatocytes retain their biochemical phenotypes and achieve greater longevity in 3-D culture in Extracel. This constitutes a new 3-D method for rapid evaluation of hepatotoxicity in vitro. Third, cancer cell lines are readily grown in 3-D culture in Extracel, offering a method for rapid evaluation of new anticancer agents in a more physiological ex vivo tumor model. This system has been used to evaluate signal transduction modifiers obtained from our research on lipid signaling. Fourth, a new "tumor engineering" xenograft model uses orthotopic injection of Extracel-containing tumor cells in nude mice. This approach allows production of patient-specific mice using primary human tumor samples and offers a superior metastatic cancer model. Future applications of the injectable cell delivery and 3-D cell culture methods include chemoattractant and angiogenesis assays, high-content automated screening of chemical libraries, pharmacogenomic and toxicogenomic studies with cultured organoids, and personalized treatment models. In summary, the sECM technology offers a versatile "translational bridge" from in vitro to in vivo to facilitate drug discovery in both academic and pharmaceutical laboratories.
17655972	The role of implicit wanting in relation to explicit liking and wanting for food: implications for appetite control.	Eating is an action open to awareness by the individual; however, it cannot be claimed that processes that control the expression of eating habits are necessarily explicit. This distinction between implicit and explicit processes may enhance understanding of the expression of food reward (particularly the concepts of liking and wanting [Berridge, K. C., & Robinson, T. E. (2003). Parsing reward. Trends in Neurosciences, 26, 507-513] and its importance for human appetite control [Finlayson, G. S., King, N. A., & Blundell, J. E. (2007b). Liking vs. wanting food: Importance for human appetite control and weight regulation. Neuroscience and Biobehavioural Reviews, in press]. The present study investigated the effect of meal-induced satiation on implicit and explicit processes of liking (L) and wanting (W) by developing a computer-based procedure to measure L and W in hungry and satiated states. Explicit measures were derived from analogue ratings whilst an implicit W measure was derived from reaction time in a forced-choice procedure, which also identified food preferences. Seventy subjects (21.8+/-0.9 years, BMI: 22.2+/-0.5 kg/m2) completed the procedure before and immediately following consumption of a savoury test meal. Satiation caused explicit ratings of L and W to decrease in all food categories (p<0.01); but with a more marked decrease for savoury foods compared with sweet foods (p<0.01). Implicit W was increased for sweet categories (p<0.01), but not for savoury. Implicit and explicit measures of L and W independently correlated with preference for sweet foods. This study provides support that implicit and explicit processes of food reward can be simultaneously measured and dissociated using a test meal. Adjustments in hunger were linked to changes in explicit L and W in a manner consistent with sensory specific satiety, while a relationship between hunger and implicit W was absent. We suggest that implicit W is not systematically downregulated by the physiological consequences of food consumption in the same way as hunger and therefore may be largely independent of homoeostatic processes influencing intake.
17656044	Escherichia coli O157:H7 and other Shiga toxin-producing E. coli in white veal calves.	The aims of the study were to determine the prevalence of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 (EHEC O157) and other Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) in feces of white veal calves in an operation in Ontario, to evaluate exposure of the calves to EHEC O157, and to investigate the milk replacer diet and antimicrobial resistance as factors that might influence the prevalence of EHEC O157. Feces from three cohorts of 20-21 calves were collected weekly for 20 weeks and processed for isolation of EHEC O157:H7 and detection of STEC by an ELISA. Exposure to EHEC O157 was also investigated by measuring IgG and IgM antibodies to the O157 lipopolysaccharide (O157 Ab) in sera by ELISA. The prevalences of EHEC O157 were 0.17% of 1151 fecal samples and 3.2% of 62 calves, and for STEC were 68% of 1005 fecal samples and 100% of 62 calves. Seroconversion to active IgG and IgM O157 Ab responses in some calves was not associated with isolation of EHEC O157. The milk replacer contained low levels of antibodies to EHEC antigens and without antimicrobial drugs, it did not inhibit the growth of EHEC O157 in vitro. Two E. coli O157:H7 that were isolated were totally drug sensitive whereas 60 commensal E. coli isolates that were examined were highly resistant. Antibodies in milk replacer that might be protective in vivo, and susceptibility to antimicrobial agents in the milk replacer may contribute to the low prevalence of EHEC O157 in white veal calves.
17656047	Real-time PCR-based prevalence study, infection follow-up and molecular characterization of canine hemotropic mycoplasmas.	Hemotropic mycoplasmas (hemoplasmas) have been reported in several mammalian species including dogs. Infections may lead to hemolytic anemia, but investigations in the dog had been hampered by the lack of adequate diagnostic methods. Only recently sensitive PCR-based assays were reported for the two canine hemoplasmas, Mycoplasma haemocanis and Candidatus Mycoplasma haematoparvum. By applying these assays, 15.4% of 460 dogs from the south of France tested hemoplasma positive. It was hypothesized that this high prevalence may be associated with the presence of Rhipicephalus sanguineus, a proposed vector for canine hemoplasmas. To address this hypothesis and expand the PCR-based knowledge on canine hemoplasmosis, we investigated dogs in a climatic zone that does not allow for the permanent establishment of R. sanguineus. Blood samples were collected throughout a year from 889 dogs in Switzerland: 1.2% of the dogs tested real-time PCR positive. The infection status was not significantly associated with anemia, age or gender. Phylogenetic analyses of Candidatus M. haematoparvum and M. haemocanis isolates revealed > or =99.8% identity to published sequences. All samples collected from three infected dogs throughout a follow-up period of < or =13 months tested PCR positive. Interestingly, the majority of the infected dogs either had been imported from or had visited regions where R. sanguineus is indigenous. Thus, canine hemoplasma prevalence was found to be low in a country with a climate incompatible with frequent occurrence of R. sanguineus. Nonetheless, veterinarians may expect hemoplasma infections in dogs with a travel history and/or after potential tick vector exposure.
17657792	Downregulation of RAD17 in head and neck cancer.	BACKGROUND: DNA repair genes play a critical role in maintaining genome stability and have been implicated in tumorigenesis. Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) often shows chromosomal instability. We examined the expression of human RAD17, a DNA damage cell cycle checkpoint gene, in primary head and neck cancer tissue. METHODS: Significance analysis of microarrays was applied to expression array results examining more than 12,000 genes in 7 samples of primary HNSCC and 6 samples of normal control oral epithelial tissue. Additional confirmation was performed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in these samples and western blot with an additional 12 primary HNSCC and 7 normal samples, followed by loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis and quantitative PCR at the RAD17 locus. RESULTS: Multiple checkpoint and DNA repair genes were downregulated in primary head and neck tumor tissue compared with normal control epithelial tissue, including hRAD17. Its Z-score and fold change were -2.5 and 0.39, respectively. The results of normalized, quantitative RT-PCR showed decreased expression of hRAD17 mRNA in tumor tissue (mean value 0.2166) when compared with normal tissue (mean value 0.3957, p < .05). Western blot demonstrated undetectable expression of hRAD17 protein in primary tumor tissue (0/12), while there was strong expression of hRAD17 protein in normal oral mucosal tissue (6/7). To determine possible mechanisms of inactivation, the hRAD17 locus at 5q13 was analyzed using microsatellite markers, showing 70% LOH in 30 primary HNSCCs. Quantitative PCR showed that RAD17 DNA copy number was decreased in the majority of head and neck tumor tissue samples. CONCLUSION: Loss of hRAD17 expression occurs frequently in HNSCC, is often due to genomic deletion, and may facilitate genomic instability in HNSCC.
17658704	Evaluation of a multiplex real-time RT-PCR for quantitative and differential detection of wild-type viruses and C-strain vaccine of Classical swine fever virus.	Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) is the causative agent of classical swine fever (CSF), one of OIE listed diseases. Most of the currently available detection methods do not allow discrimination between wild-type CSF viruses and the vaccine strains. This study was designed to develop a multiplex real-time RT-PCR for the quantitative and differential detection of wild-type viruses and C-strain vaccine widely used in China. CSFV specific primers and two differently labeled TaqMan probes for the differentiation of wild-type viruses from C-strain vaccine were designed in the 5'-untranslated region of the viral genome of CSFV. The two TaqMan probes specifically hybridize wild-type viruses of different subgroups and C-strain vaccine, respectively, in the multiplex real-time RT-PCR, with no cross-reaction to a number of non-CSFV porcine viruses. The sensitivity of the assay for detecting wild-type and C-strain-type vaccine viruses was determined to be 41.8 and 81.5copies/microL viral RNA, respectively. Completely correct differentiation of wild-type viruses from C-strain vaccine was achieved when testing reference strains and characterized field isolates of CSFV in China. The multiplex real-time RT-PCR was able to detect the viral RNA in the whole blood samples of experimentally infected pigs as early as 2 days post-infection, 3 to 4 days prior to the onset of clinical signs in co-housed pigs. The agreements between the multiplex real-time RT-PCR and a multiplex RT-nested PCR for detection of wild-type and C-strain-type viruses were 96.9% and 100%, respectively, when detecting 106 different field samples. There is a positive correlation between the titers of C-strain vaccines titrated in rabbits and RNA copies quantitated by the multiplex real-time RT-PCR. The novel assay described here is rapid and sensitive, and is useful for differentiating field strains and C-strain of CSFV in China.
17659999	An outline of the history of head and neck oncology.	This review analyzes the development of head and neck oncology as outlined in medical history articles. A systematic literature survey was conducted with the search engines "Google Scholar" and "PubMed" and the retrieved publications were cross-referenced. In addition, books and, when possible, original sources were consulted. While most of the material was obtained from publications from the modern era reviewing historical data, some of the information was derived from original source material. The obtained articles on the history of cancer were then analyzed for details on head and neck oncology. The cradle of oncology was located in ancient Egypt and Greece. The search showed that the first tumors treated in the head and neck were either cutaneous malignancies or cancers on the mucosal surfaces of the oral cavity. The origin, diagnosis and treatment of more deeply situated tumors of the larynx and hypopharynx remained obscure for many centuries. The medieval age brought little progress to medicine in general, and in head and neck oncology in particular, due to religious concerns. Renaissance medicine was characterized by advances in medicine and oncology made by systematic dissection studies of normal and pathologic anatomy. The 19th and 20th century reflect the development of head and neck oncology in the era of science based medicine. Almost all of our current understanding of head and neck oncology, our diagnostic methods and treatment strategies have been developed in these two centuries. The analysis showed that many oncologic problems, which occupy our minds today, were also concerns of our medical ancestors.
17661079	TNF controls the infiltration of dendritic cells into the site of Leishmania major infection.	TNF-negative C57BL/6 (B6.TNF(-/-)) mice are highly susceptible to Leishmania (L.) major infection and succumb rapidly to fatal leishmaniasis. A T helper type 1 (Th1) cell-mediated immune response is central for protective anti-leishmanial immunity. Therefore, the observed susceptibility of B6.TNF(-/-) mice to L. major parasites could be caused by a deficiency in mounting a Th1 response. Analysis of infected footpads revealed, that B6.TNF(-/-) mice exhibited a substantially diminished formation of DCs at the site of infection. Furthermore, Th1 cytokines such as IFN-gamma were reduced in footpads of infected B6.TNF(-/-) mice. Cutaneous reconstitution of B6.TNF(-/-) mice with either bone marrow derived DCs (BM-DCs) or recombinant TNF simultaneous to infection resulted in an increased expression of cytokines such as IFN-gamma and in an enhanced presence of Leishmania-antigen in skin draining lymph nodes. In addition, the individual time of survival was doubled. In conclusion we demonstrate that the expression of dermal TNF is necessary to provide an environment that initiates a local inflammatory response, but is not sufficient to induce protective immunity.
17662673	Analysis of the CFTR gene in Iranian cystic fibrosis patients: identification of eight novel mutations.	BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common inherited disorder in Caucasian populations, with over 1400 mutations identified in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR) gene. Mutations in the CFTR gene may be also causative for CBAVD (Congenital Bilateral Absence of the Vas Deferens). The type and distribution of mutations varies widely between different countries and/or ethnic groups, and is relatively unknown in Iran. We therefore performed a comprehensive analysis of the CFTR gene in Iranian CF patients. METHODS: 69 Iranian CF patients, and 1 CBAVD patient, were analysed for mutations in the complete coding region, and its exon/intron junctions, of their CFTR genes, using different methods, such as ARMS (amplification refractory mutation system)-PCR, SSCP (single stranded conformation polymorphism) analysis, restriction enzyme digestion analysis, direct sequencing, and MLPA (Multiplex Ligation-mediated Probe Amplification). RESULTS: CFTR mutation analysis revealed the identification of 37 mutations in 69 Iranian CF patients. Overall, 81.9% (113/138) CFTR genes derived from Iranian CF patients could be characterized for a disease-causing mutation. The CBAVD patient was found to be homozygous for the p.W1145R mutation. The most common mutations were p.F508del (DeltaF508) (18.1%), c.2183_2184delAAinsG (2183AA>G) (6.5%), p.S466X (5.8%), p.N1303K (4.3%), c.2789+5G>A (4.3%), p.G542X (3.6%), c.3120+1G>A (3.6%), p.R334W (2.9%) and c.3130delA (2.9%). These 9 types of mutant CFTR genes totaled for 52% of all CFTR genes derived from the 69 Iranian CF patients. Eight mutations, c.406-8T>C, p.A566D, c.2576delA, c.2752-1_2756delGGTGGCinsTTG, p.T1036I, p.W1145R, c.3850-24G>A, c.1342-?_1524+?del, were found for the first time in this study. CONCLUSIONS: We identified 37 CFTR mutations in 69 well characterized Iranian CF patients, obtaining a CFTR mutation detection rate of 81.9%, the highest detection rate obtained in the Iranian population so far. These findings will assist in genetic counseling, prenatal diagnosis and future screening of CF in Iran.
17666447	Patient-reported health outcomes in a trial of etanercept monotherapy versus combination therapy with etanercept and methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis: the ADORE trial.	OBJECTIVES: This study assessed the relative efficacy of etanercept (ETN) or etanercept and methotrexate (ETN+MTX) for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who had an unsatisfactory response to MTX, using patient-reported outcomes (PROs) of function, pain, general health, disease activity and morning stiffness. METHODS: The PROs were secondary assessments in a 16-week, prospective, randomised, parallel-group study conducted at 60 European centres. Patients with RA were randomly assigned either to monotherapy with ETN or combination therapy with ETN+MTX. PRO instruments administered included the Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire, the pain visual analogue scale, the EuroQoL assessment of current health state (EQ-5D), the EQ-5D visual analogue scale, a patient global assessment of disease activity and an assessment of morning stiffness. Treatment groups were compared by percentage of patients within clinically meaningful categories. The primary endpoint for all PROs was comparison of mean improvement from baseline to week 16 between ETN and ETN+MTX groups. RESULTS: Three hundred and fifteen patients were randomised to ETN or ETN+MTX. Both treatment arms had similar Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index DI, EQ-5D, patient global assessment of disease activity, pain or morning stiffness scores and improvement from baseline to week 16. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with active RA and intolerance or unsatisfactory response to MTX, substituting ETN for MTX and adding ETN to MTX are both effective ways of reducing disability, pain, disease activity, morning stiffness, and improving general health.
17667942	Antizyme, a mediator of ubiquitin-independent proteasomal degradation and its inhibitor localize to centrosomes and modulate centriole amplification.	The potential tumor suppressor antizyme and its endogenous inhibitor (antizyme inhibitor, AZI) have been implicated in the ubiquitin-independent proteasomal degradation of proteins involved in cell proliferation as well as in the regulation of polyamine levels. We show here that both antizyme and AZI concentrate at centrosomes and that antizyme preferentially associates with the maternal centriole. Interestingly, alterations in the levels of these proteins have opposing effects on centrosomes. Depletion of antizyme in various cell lines and primary cells leads to centrosome overduplication, whereas overexpression of antizyme reduces numerical centrosome abnormalities. Conversely, silencing of the antizyme inhibitor, AZI, results in a decrease of numerical centrosome abnormalities, whereas overexpression of AZI leads to centrosome overduplication. We further show that the numerical centrosome abnormalities are due to daughter centriole amplification. In summary, our results demonstrate that alterations in the antizyme/AZI balance cause numerical centrosomal defects and suggest a role for ubiquitin-independent proteasomal degradation in centrosome duplication.
17668288	The JMJD2 members of histone demethylase revisited.	The study of histone lysine demethylases has become very hot recently. Many histone demethylases have been reported by different research groups with various techniques. However, how many histone lysine-methylation states can be removed by one specific demethylase and how many demethylases can remove one specific histone lysine-methylation state? It remains a daunting challenge to answer these questions to date. An in-depth discussion on recent results, three important points were provided: (1) Some demethylases can remove more histone lysine-methylation states; (2) Some prokaryotes might be endowed with histone lysine demethylases although they are devoid of histones; (3) Protein-protein interaction provides a valuable framework for a better understanding of the functions of the histone lysine demethylases. All of these will be beneficial to a better understanding of demethylases and suggest how future research can be improved.
17669226	Audiometric and imaging characteristics of distal renal tubular acidosis and deafness.	OBJECTIVE: Primary distal renal tubular acidosis with sensorineural hearing loss is a rare autosomal recessive disease, usually caused by mutations in the ATP6V1B1 gene. The aim of this study was to characterise the phenotype of this disease, with emphasis on the auditory findings, in a cohort of Israeli children. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective study of five children, from three unrelated families, with distal renal tubular acidosis and bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, with mutations in the ATP6V1B1 gene. METHODS: The following were collected from patients' medical records: biochemical and renal data, age at distal renal tubular acidosis diagnosis, and age at hearing loss. Hearing loss progression as well as current hearing status were assessed, and high resolution computed tomography of the temporal bone was performed. All patients underwent genetic testing. RESULTS: Four patients were diagnosed with distal renal tubular acidosis before the age of six months and one at 24 months. All had the classical findings of low blood pH and inappropriately high urine pH. Hearing loss was diagnosed between the ages of three months and two years. The hearing loss was bilateral, asymmetrical and progressive, occasionally with a conductive component. Two children underwent cochlear implantation, at ages 10 and 15 years. High resolution computed tomography, performed in four patients between the ages of 2.5 and 15 years, showed bilaterally enlarged vestibular aqueducts. This was the only radiological abnormality in the inner ear in all cases. A different mutation in the ATP6V1B1 gene was found in each family. CONCLUSION: Several types of mutations in the ATP6V1B1 gene may cause distal renal tubular acidosis and sensorineural hearing loss. Patients display a typical progressive type of hearing loss and have enlarged vestibular aqueducts, with no other abnormalities being observed on imaging.
17671981	Protein homology detection and fold inference through multiple alignment entropy profiles.	Homology detection and protein structure prediction are central themes in bioinformatics. Establishment of relationship between protein sequences or prediction of their structure by sequence comparison methods finds limitations when there is low sequence similarity. Recent works demonstrate that the use of profiles improves homology detection and protein structure prediction. Profiles can be inferred from protein multiple alignments using different approaches. The "Conservatism-of-Conservatism" is an effective profile analysis method to identify structural features between proteins having the same fold but no detectable sequence similarity. The information obtained from protein multiple alignments varies according to the amino acid classification employed to calculate the profile. In this work, we calculated entropy profiles from PSI-BLAST-derived multiple alignments and used different amino acid classifications summarizing almost 500 different attributes. These entropy profiles were converted into pseudocodes which were compared using the FASTA program with an ad-hoc matrix. We tested the performance of our method to identify relationships between proteins with similar fold using a nonredundant subset of sequences having less than 40% of identity. We then compared our results using Coverage Versus Error per query curves, to those obtained by methods like PSI-BLAST, COMPASS and HHSEARCH. Our method, named HIP (Homology Identification with Profiles) presented higher accuracy detecting relationships between proteins with the same fold. The use of different amino acid classifications reflecting a large number of amino acid attributes, improved the recognition of distantly related folds. We propose the use of pseudocodes representing profile information as a fast and powerful tool for homology detection, fold assignment and analysis of evolutionary information enclosed in protein profiles.
17673436	Correlation between CFTR gene mutations in Iranian men with congenital absence of the vas deferens and anatomical genital phenotype.	Congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD) and congenital unilateral absence of the vas deferens (CUAVD) are 2 causes of male sterility; these phenotypes are found in 1%-2% of men investigated for infertility and approximately 10% of men with azoospermia. To study the correlation between genital phenotype and cystic fibrosis genotype in men lacking at least 1 vas deferens, we evaluated the role of different CFTR gene mutations in the morphologic genital phenotype of 119 infertile men with bilateral or unilateral absence of the vas deferens (112 CBAVD and 7 CUAVD patients). Renal, scrotal, and transrectal ultrasonography were systematically performed. CFTR mutations and (TG)m(T)n polymorphism were analyzed, and epididymal and seminal vesicular abnormalities and testicular volume were compared among men with 2, 1, or no CFTR gene mutation, with or without the 5T allele. Our results showed that patients with CBAVD and renal agenesis have the same reproductive tract abnormalities as those with CUAVD, and reproductive tract abnormalities were independent of the subtypes of CFTR genotype in patients with absence of the vas deferens and CFTR gene mutations. Seminal vesicles did not differ between patients with or without CFTR gene mutation, but epididymal abnormalities were more frequent in CBAVD men without the mutation. Low testicular volume was observed in CBAVD men without the CFTR and IVS8-5T mutations, so we can hypothesize that a testicular factor (genetic or environmental) rather than CFTR gene mutations plays a role in determining the phenotype. Further studies using common diagnostic criteria are required to confirm our observations.
17674087	Aerobic and anoxic growth and nitrate removal capacity of a marine denitrifying bacterium isolated from a recirculation aquaculture system.	Bacterial biofilters used in marine recirculation aquaculture systems need improvements to enhance nitrogen removal efficiency. Relatively little is known about biofilter autochthonous population structure and function. The present study was aimed at isolating and characterizing an autochthonous denitrifying bacterium from a marine biofilter installed at a recirculation aquaculture system. Colonization of four different media in a marine fish farm was followed by isolation of various denitrifying strains and molecular classification of the most promising one, strain T2, as a novel member of the Pseudomonas fluorescens cluster. This strain exhibits high metabolic versatility regarding N and C source utilization and environmental conditions for growth. It removed nitrate through aerobic assimilatory metabolism at a specific rate of 116.2 mg NO(3)-N g dw(-1) h(-1). Dissimilatory NO(3)-N removal was observed under oxic conditions at a limited rate, where transient NO(2)-N formed represented 22% (0.17 mg L(-1)) of the maximum transient NO(2)-N observed under anoxic conditions. Dissimilatory NO(3)-N removal under anoxic conditions occurred at a specific rate of 53.5 mg NO(3)-N g dw(-1) h(-1). The isolated denitrifying strain was able to colonize different materials, such as granular activated carbon (GAC), Filtralite and Bioflow plastic rings, which allow the development of a prototype bioreactor for strain characterization under dynamic conditions and mimicking fish-farm operating conditions.
17674196	Cancer associated fibroblasts stimulated by transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta 1) increase invasion rate of tumor cells: a population study.	Cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are believed to promote tumor growth and progression. Our objective was to measure the effect of TGF-beta1 on fibroblasts isolated from invasive breast cancer patients. Fibroblasts were isolated from tissue obtained at surgery from patients with invasive breast cancer (CAF; n = 28) or normal reduction mammoplasty patients (normal; n = 10). Myofibroblast activation was measured by counting cells immunostained for smooth muscle alpha actin (ACTA2) in cultures +/- TGF-beta 1. Conditioned media (CM) was collected for invasion assays and RNA was isolated from cultures incubated in media +/- TGF-beta1 for 24 h. Q-PCR was used to measure expression of cyclin D1, fibronectin, laminin, collagen I, urokinase, stromelysin-1, and ACTA2 genes. Invasion rate was measured in chambers plated with MDA-MB-231 cells and exposed to CM in the bottom chamber; the number of cells that invaded into the bottom chamber was counted. Wilcox Rank Sum tests were used to evaluate differences in CAFs and normal fibroblasts and the effect of TGF-beta 1. There was no difference in percent myofibroblasts or invasion rate between normal and CAF cultures. However, TGF-beta1 significantly increased the percent of myofibroblasts (P < 0.01) and invasion rate (P = 0.02) in CAF cultures. Stromelysin-1 expression was significantly higher in normal versus CAF cultures (P < 0.01). TGF-beta 1 significantly increased ACTA2 expression in both normal and CAF cultures (P < 0.01). Expression of fibronectin and laminin was significantly increased by TGF-beta in CAF cultures (P < 0.01). CAFs were measurably different from normal fibroblasts in response to TGF-beta 1, suggesting that TGF-beta stimulates changes in CAFs that foster tumor invasion.
17675235	Discovery of six families of fungal defensin-like peptides provides insights into origin and evolution of the CSalphabeta defensins.	The defensins with a conserved cysteine-stabilized alpha-helix and beta-sheet (CSalphabeta) structural motif are a group of unique antimicrobial polypeptides widely distributed in plants and animals. Recently, one defensin-like peptide (DLP) with high degree of sequence and structural similarity to defensins from ancient arthropods and molluscs has been identified in a saprophytic fungus [Mygind, P.H., Fischer, R.L., Schnorr, K.M., Hansen, M.T., Sönksen, C.P., Ludvigsen, S., Raventós, D., Buskov, S., Christensen, B., De Maria, L., Taboureau, O., Yaver, D., Elvig-Jørgensen, S.G., Sørensen, M.V., Christensen, B.E., Kjaerulff, S.K., Frimodt-Moller, N., Lehrer, R.I., Zasloff, M., Kristensen, H.-H., 2005. Plectasin is a peptide antibiotic with therapeutic potential from a saprophytic fungus. Nature 437, 975-980], which poses an important question regarding the evolutionary relationships of this class of effectors of innate immunity in three eukaryotic kingdoms. Here, we report the computational identification of six families of fungal DLPs in which three known defensin types (antibacterial ancient invertebrate-type defensins (AITDs), antibacterial classical insect-type defensins (CITDs), and antifungal plant/insect-type defensins (PITDs)) can be clearly assigned. Sharing of these defensin types between animals and fungi supports their closer evolutionary relationship, consistent with the Opisthokonta Hypothesis. Conservation of the PITDs across three eukaryotic kingdoms suggests their earlier origin than the antibacterial defensins, probably preceded plants and Opisthokonta split. Finally, recognition of an early gene duplication event in the Aspergillus terreus genome allows us to establish a paralogous relationship between AITDs and CITDs, which highlights extensive lineage-specific defensin gene loss during evolution.
17680259	Telomerase expression and cell proliferation in ovarian cancer cells induced by histone deacetylase inhibitors.	OBJECTIVE: Telomerase is composed primarily of catalytic subunit (hTERT) and RNA template (hTERC). Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are known to modulate transcription and change the expression of hTERT and hTERC mRNA and telomerase activity in several types of cancer cells, but it is unclear if there is a similar effect in ovarian cancer cells. METHOD: The present study was designed to evaluate the effects of HDAC inhibitors on hTERT and hTERC mRNA expression in ovarian cancer cells. SK-V-3 cells were treated with the HDAC inhibitors, trichostatinA (TSA) and sodium butyrate (NaB); the expression of hTERC and hTERT mRNA and telomerase activity were evaluated by RT-PCR and TRAP assay, respectively. RESULTS: In SK-OV-3 cells, TSA and NaB inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis. The expression of hTERT and hTERT mRNA was not suppressed even after treatment with 1.0 microM TSA and 6 mM NaB, respectively. The telomerase activity was not changed by either TSA or NaB. CONCLUSION: Histone deacetylase inhibitors inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis, but had no effect on the expression of hTERC and hTERT mRNA and on telomerase activity.
17680260	Congenital diaphragmatic hernia, etiology and management, a 10-year analysis of a single center.	OBJECTIVE: To analyze congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) during a 10-year period at the University of Kiel, from 1995 through 2004, in order to develop a strategy to improve prenatal diagnosis, to be able to consider endoscopical treatment for selected cases and to assess the current postnatal treatment strategies. METHODS: Data were obtained from the fetal medicine ultrasound department, from the birth registry, from the postmortem registry, from the neonatal intensive care unit, from pediatric surgery and from the genetic database. Data were subselected for chromosomes, genetic syndromes, for isolated CDH and for associated anomalies, the lung to head ratio and lung volumes were assessed. Data were analyzed respectively for gestation at diagnosis, the type of CDH, the perinatal management and the postnatal outcome. RESULTS: There were 29 cases of CDH, in 10/29 (34%) the parents requested termination of pregnancy of which two had already died during pregnancy, 12/19 (63%) survived, which was defined as discharge from the neonatal intensive care unit, seven newborns 7/19 (37%) died in the hospital, 5 of these 5/7 (71%) were delivered in Kiel. A prenatal diagnosis was performed in 16/29 (55%), 1/16 (6%), 7/16 (43%) and 8/16 (50%) in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd trimester, respectively; in 10/29 (34%) diagnosis was performed postpartum, in 3/29 (10%) the diagnosis was performed at autopsy following termination of pregnancy. When the liver was in the abdomen, 9/10 (90%) of the children survived, compared to only 3/8 (43%) when the liver was located in the thorax. A lung to head ratio of 0.81 at 24 weeks resulted in death due to pulmonary hypoplasia. CONCLUSIONS: The overall survival in CDH is around 50%, antenatal endoscopical therapy may only be considered, if the diagnosis is performed in the early second trimester, and selection criteria such as the lung to head ratio, associated defects and the chromosomal status can be applied.
17680699	Structure of biosynthetic N-acetylornithine aminotransferase from Salmonella typhimurium: studies on substrate specificity and inhibitor binding.	Acetylornithine aminotransferase (AcOAT) is one of the key enzymes involved in arginine metabolism and catalyzes the conversion of N-acetylglutamate semialdehyde to N-acetylornithine (AcOrn) in the presence of L-glutamate. It belongs to the Type I subgroup II family of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) dependent enzymes. E. coli biosynthetic AcOAT (eAcOAT) also catalyzes the conversion of N-succinyl-L-2-amino-6-oxopimelate to N-succinyl-L,L-diaminopimelate, one of the steps in lysine biosynthesis. In view of the critical role of AcOAT in lysine and arginine biosynthesis, structural studies were initiated on the enzyme from S. typhimurium (sAcOAT). The K(m) and k(cat)/K(m) values determined with the purified sAcOAT suggested that the enzyme had much higher affinity for AcOrn than for ornithine (Orn) and was more efficient than eAcOAT. sAcOAT was inhibited by gabaculine (Gcn) with an inhibition constant (K(i)) of 7 microM and a second-order rate constant (k(2)) of 0.16 mM(-1) s(-1). sAcOAT, crystallized in the unliganded form and in the presence of Gcn or L-glutamate, diffracted to a maximum resolution of 1.90 A and contained a dimer in the asymmetric unit. The structure of unliganded sAcOAT showed significant electron density for PLP in only one of the subunits (subunit A). The asymmetry in PLP binding could be attributed to the ordering of the loop L(alphak-) (betam) in only one subunit (subunit B; the loop from subunit B comes close to the phosphate group of PLP in subunit A). Structural and spectral studies of sAcOAT with Gcn suggested that the enzyme might have a low affinity for PLP-Gcn complex. Comparison of sAcOAT with T. thermophilus AcOAT and human ornithine aminotransferase suggested that the higher specificity of sAcOAT towards AcOrn may not be due to specific changes in the active site residues but could result from minor conformational changes in some of them. This is the first structural report of AcOAT from a mesophilic organism and could serve as a basis for drug design as the enzyme is important for bacterial cell wall biosynthesis.
17681435	Glycosylation of type-IV fimbriae of Dichelobacter nodosus.	Dichelobacter nodosus is the causative agent of ovine footrot and the type-IV fimbriae on this bacterium are essential for maintaining its virulence. In this study, we reveal that these fimbriae are glycosylated. This was demonstrated in several ways: by the detection of carbohydrate on fimbrial protein using periodic acid Schiff reagent (PAS) staining of SDS-PAGE gels and by demonstrating enzymatic deglycosylation and by analysis of the amino acid sequences derived from the fimA gene, whereby the gene from isolates of D. nodosus that appeared to be glycosylated had potential glycosylation sites both inside and outside of the variable region of fimA. The results would also explain the observation that the calculated molecular weight of fimA from some D. nodosus serotypes does not correlate with the apparent size determined from electrophoretic mobility.
17681490	Plastid inheritance in the planktonic raphid pennate diatom Pseudo-nitzschia delicatissima (Bacillariophyceae).	Plastid inheritance was followed during sexual reproduction in the raphid pennate diatom Pseudo-nitzschia delicatissima, using rbcL haplotypes as plastid identification tools. Pseudo-nitzschia species are dioecious and show functional anisogamy with 'male' mating type+(PNd(+)) cells and 'female' PNd(-) cells. Vegetative cells possess two plastids. In P. delicatissima, meiosis results in two gametes that both contribute two plastids to the zygote. The latter initially contains four plastids, but during auxospore development two of these four seem to disappear, and the initial cell emerging from the auxospore appears to contain only two. Here we assessed if the plastids are inherited strictly unipaternally, strictly biparentally, or randomly. We traced the source of the plastids in the F(1) generation by using PNd(+) and PNd(-) parental strains with different rbcL genotypes, here denoted AA (homoplastidial, with two plastids of rbcL haplotype A) and BB (homoplastidial; two plastids of haplotype B). Results showed that 16 out of 96 strains raised each from single F(1) cells had retained two paternal (PNd(+)) plastids, 20 had two maternal (PNd(-)) plastids and the remaining 60 had one maternal and one paternal plastid. This pattern is in accordance with the hypothesis that either two of the four plastids are eliminated during auxospore formation, or that all plastids are retained in the auxospore and segregate in pairs joining at random during the first mitotic division of the initial cell. Heteroplastidic F(1)-strains retained the AB genotype throughout the vegetative phase of their life cycle. The finding that 60 out of 96 F(1) strains were heteroplastidial contrasts with an absence of such genotypes in our strains raised from single cells sampled in the Gulf of Naples.
17681637	Emotional responses to food, body dissatisfaction and other eating disorder features in children, adolescents and young adults.	We aimed to assess and compare emotional responses to different foods in relationship to eating disorder and associated features, across gender and age groups. We hypothesized that negative emotional responses to images of foods would be higher in (i) those with higher body dissatisfaction and (ii) older females. Five hundred and thirty-six (18% Grade 5, 39% Grade 8 or 9, and 43% Grade 11 or 12) school, and 93 university students participated. Emotive responses to images of foods were assessed with a PowerPoint presentation of 16 differing food and four 'neutral' images shown over 30s intervals. Responses were rated on three 10-cm visual analog scales measuring levels of happiness, fear and disgust. Body image concern was assessed with the nine-item body dissatisfaction subscale of the EDI and eating disorder symptoms with the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire. With increasing age all three emotional responses towards food fell and body dissatisfaction increased. Compared to females, males showed significantly higher levels of a 'happy' response to food, and in adult females a fear emotive response correlated positively with eating concern and body dissatisfaction. In men, positive emotive responses to food may be indicative of broader factors that reduce their vulnerability to eating disorders.
17681875	Chromosomal imbalances in oral squamous cell carcinoma: examination of 31 cell lines and review of the literature.	Classical and molecular cytogenetic analysis, including fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and chromosomal comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), were used to examine genetic changes involved in the development and/or progression of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Of 31 OSCC cell lines studied, more than one-third expressed clonal structural abnormalities involving chromosomes 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11. Eleven OSCC cell lines were evaluated using CGH to identify novel genome-wide gains, losses, or amplifications. By CGH, more than half of the cell lines showed loss of 3p, gain of 3q, 8q, and 20q. Further, molecular cytogenetic analyses by FISH of primary tumors showed that the karyotypes of cell lines derived from those tumors correlated with specific gains and losses in the tumors from which they were derived. The most frequent nonrandom aberration identified by both karyotype and CGH analyses was amplification of chromosomal band 11q13 in the form of a homogeneously staining region. Our data suggest that loss of 9p and 11q13 amplification may be of prognostic benefit in the management of OSCC, which is consistent with the literature. The results of this study validate the relationship between these OSCC cell lines and the tumors from which they were derived. The results also emphasize the usefulness of these cell lines as in vitro experimental models and provide important genetic information on these OSCC cell lines that were recently reported in this journal.
17683499	Transforming growth factor-alpha accelerates hepatocyte repopulation after hepatocyte transplantation.	BACKGROUND AND AIM: Although hepatocyte transplantation could be an alternative to orthotopic liver transplantation, many problems, such as rejection, location, required volume, and hepatocyte activity are currently unresolved. We previously demonstrated an anti-apoptotic effect in transgenic mice overexpressing transforming growth factor (TGF)-alpha. We herein present the details of a successful hepatocyte transplantation using TGF-alpha transgenic mice. METHODS: We used transgenic (TG) mice which overexpressed human TGF-alpha controlled by the metallothionein promoter. Wild-type mice were used as the controls (WT). Parenchymal hepatocytes were isolated from an adult mouse by the modified in situ perfusion method. The proliferation and resistance to Fas-induced apoptosis were examined in vitro. In addition, we transplanted the parenchymal hepatocytes into the peritoneal cavity of the WT mice. RESULTS: The TG hepatocytes showed higher proliferative activity and more resistance to Fas-induced apoptosis in comparison to the WT hepatocytes. Moreover, an immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that the transplanted TG hepatocytes increased more in size and showed a higher expression of CD31 and vascular endothelial growth factor in comparison to the WT hepatocytes. We also observed that albumin was expressed in equal amounts in both types of transplanted hepatocytes. CONCLUSION: Cell transplantation with TGF-alpha overexpressing hepatocytes could preserve hepatocyte function.
17685457	Missing phenotype data imputation in pedigree data analysis.	Mapping complex traits or phenotypes with small genetic effects, whose phenotypes may be modulated by temporal trends in families are challenging. Detailed and accurate data must be available on families, whether or not the data were collected over time. Missing data complicate matters in pedigree analysis, especially in the case of a longitudinal pedigree analysis. Because most analytical methods developed for the analysis of longitudinal pedigree data require no missing data, the researcher is left with the option of dropping those cases (individuals) with missing data from the analysis or imputing values for the missing data. We present the use of data augmentation within Bayesian polygenic and longitudinal polygenic models to produce k complete datasets. The data augmentation, or imputation step of the Markov chain Monte Carlo, takes into account the observed familial information and the observed subject information available at other time points. These k complete datasets can then be used to fit single time point or longitudinal pedigree models. By producing a set of k complete datasets and thus k sets of parameter estimates, the total variance associated with an estimate can be partitioned into a within-imputation and a between-imputation component. The method is illustrated using the Genetic Analysis Workshop simulated data.
17687644	Anti-estrogenic mechanism of unliganded progesterone receptor isoform B in breast cancer cells.	Over half of breast cancer cases are estrogen-dependent and strategies to combat estrogen-dependent breast cancer have been to either block the activation of estrogen receptor (ER) or diminish the supply of estrogens. Our previous work documented that estrogen-independent expression of progesterone receptor (PR) in MCF-7 cells markedly disrupted the effects of estrogen. In this study, we have developed an adenovirus-mediated gene delivery system to study the specific involvement of PR isoform A (PR-A) and PR-B in the anti-estrogenic effect and its mechanism of action. The results revealed that PR-B, but not PR-A, exhibited distinct anti-estrogenic effect on E2-induced cell growth, gene expression, and ER-ERE interaction in a ligand-independent manner. The anti-estrogenic effect of PR-B was also associated with heightened metabolism and increased cellular uptake of estradiol-17 beta (E2). We have also found that the B-upstream segment of PR-B alone was able to inhibit E2-induced ER-ERE interaction and cellular uptake of E2. Although PR-A alone did not affect E2-induced ER activity, it antagonized the anti-estrogenic effect of PR-B in a concentration-dependent manner. The findings suggest an important mechanism of maintaining a favorable level of ER activity by PR-A and PR-B in estrogen target cells for optimal growth and differentiation. The potential anti-estrogenic mechanism of PR-B may be exploited for breast cancer therapy.
17688260	Differentiation stage alters matrix control of stem cells.	Cues from the material to which a cell is adherent (e.g., adhesion ligand presentation, substrate elastic modulus) clearly influence the phenotype of differentiated cells. However, it is currently unclear if stem cells respond similarly to these cues. This study examined how the overall density and nanoscale organization of a model cell adhesion ligand (arginine-glycine-aspartic acid [RGD] containing peptide) presented from hydrogels of varying stiffness regulated the proliferation of a clonally derived stem cell line (D1 cells) and preosteoblasts (MC3T3-E1). While the growth rate of MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts was responsive to nanoscale RGD ligand organization and substrate stiffness, the D1 stem cells were less sensitive to these cues in their uncommitted state. However, once the D1 cells were differentiated towards the osteoblast lineage, they became more responsive to these signals. These results demonstrate that the cell response to material cues is dependent on the stage of cell commitment or differentiation, and these findings will likely impact the design of biomaterials for tissue regeneration.
17689610	The morphological subcategories of acute monocytic leukemia (M5a and M5b) share similar immunophenotypic and cytogenetic features and clinical outcomes.	Acute monocytic leukemia (M5) is a subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with two distinct morphologic subcategories, M5a and M5b. We compared the immunophenotype, cytogenetics and clinical outcome of AML M5 with non-M5 AML and also compared M5a with M5b. One hundred and twelve M5 (76 M5a, 36 M5b) and 726 non-M5 cases were identified and treated on protocols at our institution. There were no significant differences in immunophenotype between M5a and M5b. Translocation 11q23 was the sole abnormality in 18.6% of M5 and 3.2% of non-M5 (p<0.001). Trisomy 8 was also more prevalent in M5 (16.9%) than in non-M5 (8.7%; p=0.03). There was no significant difference in karyotypes between M5a and M5b. The complete remission rate was 70% for AML M5 and 57% for non-M5 AML (p=0.03). There was no significant difference in median overall survival or disease free survival for patients with M5 versus non-M5, M5a versus M5b. Our data indicate that the prognosis of AML M5 is similar to non-M5 AML and that M5a and M5b do not differ in immunophenotype, cytogenetics or clinical outcome.
17690330	PKR regulates TLR2/TLR4-dependent signaling in murine alveolar macrophages.	The double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-activated serine/threonine kinase R (PKR) is well characterized as an essential component of the innate antiviral response. Recently, PKR has been implicated in Toll-like receptor (TLR) signal transduction in response to bacterial cell wall components. Its contribution to pulmonary immunity, however, has not yet been elucidated. In this report we investigated whether PKR is involved in TLR2/TLR4-mediated immune responses of primary alveolar macrophages (AM). We found that both TLR2 (Pam3CSK4) and TLR4 (LPS) ligands induced rapid phosphorylation of PKR. Moreover, this activation was strictly dependent on the functionality of the respective TLR. Pharmacologic inhibition of PKR activity using 2-aminopurine (2-AP) and PKR gene deletion was found to reduce the TLR2/TLR4-induced activation of the JNK signaling pathway (MKK4/JNK/c-Jun), but did not affect p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 activation. Moreover, inhibition of PKR phosphorylation severely impaired TNF-alpha and IL-6 production by AM in response to LPS and Pam3CSK4. In addition, we found that PKR phosphorylation plays a major role in LPS- but not Pam3CSK4-induced activation of the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB. Collectively, these results indicate that functional PKR is critically involved in inflammatory responses of primary AM to gram-positive as well as gram-negative bacterial cell wall components.
17690835	Dissolution of dead corals by euendolithic microorganisms across the northern Great Barrier Reef (Australia).	Spatial and temporal variabilities in species composition, abundance, distribution, and bioeroding activity of euendolithic microorganisms were investigated in experimental blocks of the massive coral Porites along an inshore-offshore transect across the northern Great Barrier Reef (Australia) over a 3-year period. Inshore reefs showed turbid and eutrophic waters, whereas the offshore reefs were characterized by oligotrophic waters. The euendolithic microorganisms and their ecological characteristics were studied using techniques of microscopy, petrographic sections, and image analysis. Results showed that euendolithic communities found in blocks of coral were mature. These communities were dominated by the chlorophyte Ostreobium quekettii, the cyanobacterium Plectonema terebrans, and fungi. O. quekettii was found to be the principal agent of microbioerosion, responsible for 70-90% of carbonate removal. In the offshore reefs, this oligophotic chlorophyte showed extensive systems of filaments that penetrated deep inside coral skeletons (up to 4.1 mm) eroding as much as 1 kg CaCO3 eroded m(-2) year(-1). The percentage of colonization by euendolithic filaments at the surface of blocks did not vary significantly among sites, while their depths of penetration, especially that of O. quekettii (0.6-4.1 mm), increased significantly and gradually with the distance from the shore. Rates of microbioerosion (0.1-1.4 kg m(-2) after 1 year and 0.2-1.3 kg m(-2) after 3 years of exposure) showed a pattern similar to the one found for the depth of penetration of O. quekettii filaments. Accordingly, oligotrophic reefs had the highest rates ofmicrobioerosion ofup to 1.3 kg m(-2) year(-1), whereas the development of euendolithic communities in inshore reefs appeared to be limited by turbidity, high sedimentation rates, and low grazing pressure (rates < 0.5 kg m(-2) after 3 years). Those results suggest that boring microorganisms, including O. quekettii, have a significant impact on the overall calcium carbonate budget of coral reef ecosystems, which varies according to environmental conditions.
17690931	Distal renal tubular acidosis and ovalocytosis: a case report.	A 23-year-old man presented with osteoporosis, revealed by femoral fractures, and a history of nephrolithiasis, short stature, metabolic acidosis, hypokalemia and ovalocytosis, a red blood cell abnormality common in malaria endemic regions. Biological investigations led to the diagnosis of type 1 distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA). Ovalocytosis and dRTA may co-exist in the same patient, since both can originate in mutations of the anion-exchanger 1 (AE1) gene, which codes for band 3, the bicarbonate/chloride exchanger, present in both the red cell membrane and the basolateral membrane of the collecting tubule alpha-intercalated cell.
17694332	Studies on crystallization and cross-linking of lipase for biocatalysis.	The development of robust biocatalysts with increased stability and activity is a major challenge to industry. A major breakthrough in this field was the development of cross-linked enzyme crystals with high specificity and stability. A method is described to produce micro crystals of CLEC lipase, which is thermostable and solvent stable. Lipase from Burkholderia cepacia was crystallized using ammonium sulfate and cross-linked with glutaraldehyde to produce catalytically active enzyme. The maximum yield of CLEC was obtained with 70% ammonium sulfate and cross-linked with 5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde. SEM studies showed small hexagonal-shaped crystals of 2-5 microm size. CLEC lipase had improved thermal and reuse stability. It is versatile, having good activity in both polar and nonpolar organic solvents. CLEC lipase was coated using beta cyclodextrin for improving the storage and reuse stability. CLEC was successfully used for esterification of Ibuprofen and synthesis of ethyl butyrate.
17697393	Visual attention and self-regulation of driving among older adults.	BACKGROUND: With the number of older drivers increasing, self-regulation of driving has been proposed as a viable means of balancing the autonomy of older adults against the sometimes competing demand of public safety. In this study, we investigate self-regulation of driving among a group of older adults with varying functional abilities. METHOD: Participants in the study comprised 1,543 drivers aged 75 years or older. They completed an objective measure of visual attention from which crash risk was estimated, and self-report measures of driving avoidance, driving exposure, physical functioning, general health status, and vision. Crash records were obtained from the State Department of Public Safety. RESULTS: Overall, participants were most likely to avoid driving in bad weather followed by driving at night, driving on high traffic roads, driving in unfamiliar areas, and making left-hand turns across oncoming traffic. With the exception of driving at night, drivers at higher risk of crashes generally reported greater avoidance of these driving situations than lower risk drivers. However, across all driving situations a significant proportion of higher risk drivers did not restrict their driving. In general, self-regulation of driving did not result in reduced social engagement. CONCLUSION: Some older drivers with visual attention impairments do not restrict their driving in difficult situations. There is a need for physicians and family members to discuss driving behaviors with older adults routinely to ensure their safety. The association between visual attention and driving restriction also has implications for interventions aimed at preserving mobility in the elderly.
17697431	Naturally occurring iodine in humic substances in drinking water in Denmark is bioavailable and determines population iodine intake.	Iodine intake is important for thyroid function. Iodine content of natural waters is high in some areas and occurs bound in humic substances. Tap water is a major dietary source but bioavailability of organically bound iodine may be impaired. The objective was to assess if naturally occurring iodine bound in humic substances is bioavailable. Tap water was collected at Randers and Skagen waterworks and spot urine samples were collected from 430 long-term Randers and Skagen dwellers, who filled in a questionnaire. Tap water contained 2 microg/l elemental iodine in Randers and 140 microg/l iodine bound in humic substances in Skagen. Median (25; 75 percentile) urinary iodine excretion among Randers and Skagen dwellers not using iodine-containing supplements was 50 (37; 83) microg/24 h and 177 (137; 219) microg/24 h respectively (P < 0.001). The fraction of samples with iodine below 100 microg/24 h was 85.0 % in Randers and 6.5 % in Skagen (P < 0.001). Use of iodine-containing supplements increased urinary iodine by 60 microg/24 h (P < 0.001). This decreased the number of samples with iodine below 100 microg/24 h to 67.3 % and 5.0 % respectively, but increased the number of samples with iodine above 300 microg/24 h to 2.4 % and 16.1 %. Bioavailability of iodine in humic substances in Skagen tap water was about 85 %. Iodine in natural waters may be elemental or found in humic substances. The fraction available suggests an importance of drinking water supply for population iodine intake, although this may not be adequate to estimate population iodine intake.
17697447	Exploring psychological mechanisms of collective action: does relevance of group identity influence how people cope with collective disadvantage?	Two studies examined how the relevance of group identity influences two psychological mechanisms of collective action: Emotion- and problem-focused coping with collective disadvantage. Extending Van Zomeren, Spears, Fischer, and Leach's (2004) integrative theoretical model of coping with collective disadvantage, we predicted that when group identity is more relevant to disadvantaged group members, it increases their collective action tendencies through their feelings of group-based anger about their group's disadvantage. When group identity is less relevant and hence emotion-focused coping processes are less likely, group-efficacy beliefs become more predictive of disadvantaged group members' collective action tendencies because people focus more instrumentally on whether collective action will be effective (and benefit them) or not. A field study and a follow-up experiment both showed that the relevance of group identity facilitated emotion-focused coping and moderated problem-focused coping with collective disadvantage. We discuss these results in terms of two distinct psychological mechanisms of collective action.
17697678	Transforming students' views of gerontological nursing: realising the potential of 'enriched' environments of learning and care: a multi-method longitudinal study.	BACKGROUND: Gerontological nursing is often viewed as unchallenging and is rarely a positive career choice for student nurses. Issues of recruitment and retention in gerontological nursing are a global phenomenon and strategies are needed to encourage more students to opt for this area of work. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To identify the role and influence of students' learning experiences on shaping their predispositions to work with older people and to identify the characteristics of a positive learning environment that might promote a more favourable view of gerontological nursing. METHODS: The study was a 312-year longitudinal investigation using multiple methods of data collection and analysis, including an extensive review of the literature, large-scale postal surveys, focus groups and case studies of clinical placements. The design of the study was emergent and essentially constructivist, and participants, especially student nurses, were actively engaged in the on-going process of data analysis. FINDINGS: The results suggest that students do not necessarily enter nurse training with negative predispositions towards work with older adults, but that such negative views develop during their training largely as a result of clinical placements and extra-curricula paid work. Student nurses are often exposed to 'impoverished' environments of care in which they witness poor standards of care and negative attitudes towards older people. However, if they experienced 'enriched' environments they are far more likely to view gerontological nursing in a favourable light. The characteristics of an enriched environment can be understood using the Senses Framework as an analytic lens to interpret students' learning experiences. RELEVANCE TO PRACTICE: The study reinforces the vital role that the placement experience plays in helping students to identify with a particular area of practice. The promotion of an 'enriched' environment of learning and care can be used to help ensure that students have a positive experience of learning to care for older people.
17697777	Coffee oil as a potential feedstock for biodiesel production.	A preliminary evaluation of the feasibility of producing biodiesel using oil extracted from defective coffee beans was conducted as an alternative means of utilizing these beans instead of roasting for consumption of beverage with depreciated quality. Direct transesterifications of triglycerides from refined soybean oil (reference) and from oils extracted from healthy and defective coffee beans were performed. Type of alcohol employed and time were the reaction parameters studied. Sodium methoxide was used as alkaline catalyst. There was optimal phase separation after reactions using both soybean and healthy coffee beans oils when methanol was used. This was not observed when using the oil from defective beans which required further processing to obtain purified alkyl esters. Nevertheless, coffee oil was demonstrated to be a potential feedstock for biodiesel production, both from healthy and defective beans, since the corresponding oils were successfully converted to fatty acid methyl and ethyl esters.
17698928	A new efficient statistical test for detecting variability in the gene expression data.	DNA microarray technology allows researchers to monitor the expressions of thousands of genes under different conditions. The detection of differential gene expression under two different conditions is very important in microarray studies. Microarray experiments are multi-step procedures and each step is a potential source of variance. This makes the measurement of variability difficult because approach based on gene-by-gene estimation of variance will have few degrees of freedom. It is highly possible that the assumption of equal variance for all the expression levels may not hold. Also, the assumption of normality of gene expressions may not hold. Thus it is essential to have a statistical procedure which is not based on the normality assumption and also it can detect genes with differential variance efficiently. The detection of differential gene expression variance will allow us to identify experimental variables that affect different biological processes and accuracy of DNA microarray measurements.In this article, a new nonparametric test for scale is developed based on the arctangent of the ratio of two expression levels. Most of the tests available in literature require the assumption of normal distribution, which makes them inapplicable in many situations, and it is also hard to verify the suitability of the normal distribution assumption for the given data set. The proposed test does not require the assumption of the distribution for the underlying population and hence makes it more practical and widely applicable. The asymptotic relative efficiency is calculated under different distributions, which show that the proposed test is very powerful when the assumption of normality breaks down. Monte Carlo simulation studies are performed to compare the power of the proposed test with some of the existing procedures. It is found that the proposed test is more powerful than commonly used tests under almost all the distributions considered in the study. A microarray data is used to illustrate the working of the proposed test. Results indicate that the proposed test is very powerful in detecting the smallest change in differential expression variance with high degree of confidence than some of its competitors.
17700593	The influence of fluorouracil outcome parameters on tolerance and efficacy in patients with advanced colorectal cancer.	The purpose of this study was to determine simple genetic factors helpful to tailor 5-FU administration and determine strategy in first-line chemotherapy of advanced colorectal cancer. In 76 patients initially treated by 5-FU, thymidylate synthase, dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase and methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase germinal polymorphisms, dihydrouracil/uracil plasma ratio and 5-FU plasma clearance were investigated and correlated for tolerance (10.5% grade 3 and 4 toxicity) and efficacy (32.9% objective response rate and 20 months median overall survival time). Toxicity was linked to performance status >2 (P=0.004), low UH2/U ratio, 2846 A>T, IVS 14+1G>A for DPD (P=0.031), and homozygoty C/C for MTHFR 1298 A>C (P=0.0018). The overall survival of the patients with a 3R/3R TS genotype associated with C/C for 677 C>T or A/A for 1298 A>C was statistically shorter (log-rank test P=0.0065). Genetic factors permit the tailoring of 5-FU treatment. They should occupy center stage in future clinical trials for specifically designing treatment for patients with a given biologic feature.
17700638	Application of proteomics to ecology and population biology.	Proteomics is a relatively new scientific discipline that merges protein biochemistry, genome biology and bioinformatics to determine the spatial and temporal expression of proteins in cells, tissues and whole organisms. There has been very little application of proteomics to the fields of behavioral genetics, evolution, ecology and population dynamics, and has only recently been effectively applied to the closely allied fields of molecular evolution and genetics. However, there exists considerable potential for proteomics to impact in areas related to functional ecology; this review will introduce the general concepts and methodologies that define the field of proteomics and compare and contrast the advantages and disadvantages with other methods. Examples of how proteomics can aid, complement and indeed extend the study of functional ecology will be discussed including the main tool of ecological studies, population genetics with an emphasis on metapopulation structure analysis. Because proteomic analyses provide a direct measure of gene expression, it obviates some of the limitations associated with other genomic approaches, such as microarray and EST analyses. Likewise, in conjunction with associated bioinformatics and molecular evolutionary tools, proteomics can provide the foundation of a systems-level integration approach that can enhance ecological studies. It can be envisioned that proteomics will provide important new information on issues specific to metapopulation biology and adaptive processes in nature. A specific example of the application of proteomics to sperm ageing is provided to illustrate the potential utility of the approach.
17701151	[Transthoracic echocardiography as a diagnostic tool in patients with thoracic stab wounds: early ultrasonographic evaluation in the emergency room].	Penetrating chest trauma involving the heart is usually known with a high mortality rate. Neither the absence of hemodynamic depression nor ECG changes exclude a potential fatal injury to the heart. We report on the diagnosis and definitive treatment of a stab wound injury with transected coronary artery, concomittant ventricular penetration, and pulmonary injury.A 37-year-old female was admitted to our emergency room with multiple left-sided gashes (cheek, neck, upper extremity) and a single stab wound in the left thorax. At the scene of the accident the patient's hemodynamic condition was stable with no signs of shock or shortness of breath. Auscultation revealed regular respiratory sound on both lung sides. Hospital transfer by ground was uneventful. Chest X-ray showed left pleural effusion with no signs of pneumothorax. ECG demonstrated regular sinus rhythm without repolarization changes or low voltage. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed pericardial effusion with a swinging heart. The patient was electively intubated in the emergency room and transferred to the operating room for pericardial paracentesis. Median sternotomy was necessary due to extensive bleeding in the drain. Examination of the heart showed a laceration of the left coronary artery (LAD), left ventricle, and upper lobe of the left lung. Cardiopulmonary bypass was instituted and the LAD was ligated proximal to the penetration. The left internal thoracic artery was used for coronary revascularization of the LAD. Postoperative ECG and creatine kinase evaluations excluded myocardial ischemia. The patient was discharged from hospital at POD 10 fully recovered. Transthoracic echocardiography in the emergency room is the diagnostic tool of choice to exclude/confirm a potential cardiac injury. In the case of pericardial effusion, paracentesis sometimes followed by thoracotomy should be performed. The importance of rapid diagnosis and intervention should be emphasized to reduce mortality due to cardiac tamponade or acute myocardial infarction as illustrated by this case.
17703285	Influence of expectation on postural disturbance evoked by proprioceptive stimulation.	Recent experiments have shown that the vestibular channel of balance control differs fundamentally from the visual channel. Whereas the response to a visual perturbation can be suppressed if the subject has awareness that an upcoming disturbance is likely to be caused by an external agent rather than by self-motion, a similar assumption cannot be made concerning the vestibular system. The present experiment investigated whether postural responses evoked by a proprioceptive perturbation (vibration of the Achilles' tendon at 90 Hz for 2.2 s) are either automatic and immune to expectation (similarly to vestibular responses) or cognitively penetrable (similarly to visual responses). Subjects (n = 12) stood on a force platform while stimuli were delivered either by the subject himself (self-triggered condition) or by the experimenter. For the latter condition, the stimulus was delivered either without warning (unpredictable condition) or at a fixed interval (500 ms) following an auditory cue (precue condition). Results showed that the backward CoP displacement induced by vibration was delayed by approximately 500 ms in the expected and self-triggered conditions compared to the unexpected condition. However, once initiated, the velocity of the backward displacement was higher in the self-triggered condition as compared to the unexpected condition. After a period of 2.2 s of vibration, the amplitude of this backward CoP displacement was similar in the three experimental conditions. Therefore, although expectation appears to delay the upcoming of the main backward body sway, it does not appear to be able to weight the impact of the proprioceptive stimulation. This suggested that afferents provided by the different sensory channels involved in postural control are not similarly susceptible to high level processes such as expectation.
17703366	Contamination indices and heavy metal concentrations in urban soil of Ibadan metropolis, southwestern Nigeria.	An assessment was conducted on soils of Ibadan metropolis using geochemical approach in order to establish the concentration of heavy metals and develop geoaccumulation index maps. Petrographic studies and X-ray diffractograms showed that soils of Ibadan were derived from the weathering of the bedrocks. The concentrations of Cu, Pb, and Zn were found to be greater in soils more than the background. Positive correlation occurred between Cu, Pb, and Zn indicated a common anthropogenic source in the soil while Mn, Cr, and Ni were found to be naturally enriched. The geoaccumulation index maps revealed significant enrichment factor (Ef 20) and index of geoaccumulation (Igeo) beyond class four (heavily contaminated) for Cu, Pb, and Zn in densely populated and industrial areas, whereas Cd is enriched in sparsely populated areas, agricultural areas and a few spots in densely populated areas.
17703939	A novel Angiogenin gene mutation in a sporadic patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis from southern Italy.	Mutations in the Angiogenin gene (ANG) linked to 14q11.2 have been recently discovered to be associated with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) in Irish and Scottish populations. In our study we investigated the role of ANG gene in ALS patients from southern Italy. We found a novel mutation in the signal peptide of the ANG gene in a sporadic patient with ALS (SALS). The molecular analysis of the ANG gene also demonstrated an allelic association with the rs11701 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in familial ALS (FALS) but not in SALS patients. Our finding supports the evidence that the ANG gene is involved in ALS.
17704892	Functional proteomics to identify critical proteins in signal transduction pathways.	Reversible protein phosphorylation plays a crucial role in the regulation of signaling pathways that control various biological responses, such as cell growth, differentiation, invasion, metastasis and apoptosis. Proteomics is a powerful research approach for fully monitoring global molecular responses to the activation of signal transduction pathways. Identification of different phosphoproteins and their phosphorylation sites by functional proteomics provides informational insights into signaling pathways triggered by all kinds of factors. This review summarizes how functional proteomics can be used to answer specific questions related to signal transduction systems of interest. By examining our own example on identifying the novel phosphoproteins in signaling pathways activated by EB virus-encoded latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1), we demonstrated a functional proteomic strategy to elucidate the molecular activity of phosphorylated annexin A2 in LMP1 signaling pathway. Functional profiling of signaling pathways is promising for the identification of novel targets for drug discovery and for the understanding of disease pathogenesis.
17705271	Quantifying the relationship of protein burying depth and sequence.	Protein burying depth (BD) is a structural descriptor that is exploited not only to find whether a residue is exposed or buried, but also to determine how deep a residue is buried. The widely used solvent accessible surface area is mainly focusing on the study of protein surface residues, while protein BD can provide more detailed information about the arrangement of buried residues, which may be used to study protein deep level structure and the formation of protein folding nucleus. In this work, we analyse the relationship of protein BD and sequences, and describe it by nonlinear functions estimated by support vector machines. We examine the functions by crossvalidation tests and find strong correlation between residue BD and local sequence environment. By further taking account the size of the molecule where a residue is located, we find that the correlation coefficient between predicted and observed depths improves from 0.60 to 0.65. Moreover, nearly half of the deepest 10% residues in a protein sequence can be correctly predicted. Our study suggests that a residue's burying extent is able to be predicted, to some degree, by itself and its local neighbouring residues. The methods used to estimate the sequence-depth functions are expected to become more useful in the investigation of protein structures and folding mechanism.
17705291	Alpha-synuclein and its role in metal binding: relevance to Parkinson's disease.	Parkinson's disease and some other neurodegenerative disorders are associated with a protein that can aggregate and form fibrils called alpha-synuclein. Like many other proteins associated with neurodegenerative disorders, this protein has no known function, and the mechanism by which it could cause diseases is poorly defined. It was recently suggested that it binds copper. This review assesses what is known about alpha-synuclein and its interaction with metals.
17706202	Estrogen receptor alpha gene polymorphisms are associated with idiopathic premature ovarian failure.	OBJECTIVE: To assess the role of hormone receptor/binding protein variants in genetic predisposition to premature ovarian failure (POF). DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: Academic. PATIENT(S): Fifty-five POF patients, 107 control women from the general population, and 27 control women who had proven fertility after age 37. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Allele distributions in cases and controls were assessed for genetic association. RESULT(S): Allele distributions of polymorphisms at the androgen receptor (AR) gene, estrogen receptor beta (ESR2) gene, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) gene, and FSH receptor (FSHR) gene did not differ between patients and controls. At a repeat in a promoter of the estrogen receptor alpha(ESR1) gene, POF patients had fewer (<18) short repeat alleles than did controls (P=.004 vs. combined controls). Genotypes consisting of two short alleles were found in 36.4% of control women but only 5.5% of POF patients (P<.0001 vs. combined controls). The ESR1 repeat may confer risk for POF in a simple dominant manner in which carriers of a long repeat have a relative risk of 9.7 (95% CI = 2.6 - 35.6). CONCLUSION(S): Polymorphisms at the ESR1 gene are associated with POF in this patient population, while those in AR, ESR2, SHBG, and FSHR showed no association. Further studies are necessary to confirm these findings in larger patient samples and to identify the specific predisposing lesion.
17706296	Immune responses of swine inoculated with a recombinant fowlpox virus co-expressing P12A and 3C of FMDV and swine IL-18.	Two recombinant fowlpox viruses (rFPV-P1 and rFPV-IL18-2AP12A) containing foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) capsid polypeptide, 3C coding regions of O/NY00 were evaluated to determine their abilities to induce humoral and cellular responses in the presence or absence of swine IL-18 as genetic adjuvant. The ability to protect swine against homologous virus challenge was examined. All swine were given booster vaccinations at 21 days after the initial inoculation and were challenged 10 days after the booster vaccination. Control groups were inoculated with wild-type fowlpox virus (wtFPV). All animals vaccinated with rFPV-P12A and rFPV-IL18-P12A developed specific anti-FMDV ELISA antibody and neutralizing antibody and T-lymphocyte proliferation was observed. Cellular immune function was evaluated via examination of IFN-gamma production in swine peripheral blood serum. The results demonstrate the potential viability of a fowlpox virus-based recombinant vaccine in the control and prevention of FMDV infections.
17706678	Endovascular cooling in a patient with neuroleptic malignant syndrome.	We report a case of severe neuroleptic malignant syndrome with hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis and hepatic failure where we applied endovascular cooling in order to reverse hyperthermia. After rapid normalization of core temperature at 37.5 degrees C, the patient's condition improved and CK levels dropped. However, upon withdrawl of endovascular temperature control there was a relapse. This is the first case where endovascular cooling was applied successfully in neuroleptic malignant syndrome.
17707146	Metallosensors, the ups and downs of gene regulation.	In fungal cells, transcriptional regulatory mechanisms play a central role in both the homeostatic regulation of the essential metals iron, copper and zinc and in the detoxification of heavy metal ions such as cadmium. Fungi detect changes in metal ion levels using unique metallo-regulatory factors whose activity is responsive to the cellular metal ion status. New studies have revealed that these factors not only regulate the expression of genes required for metal ion acquisition, storage or detoxification but also globally remodel metabolism to conserve metal ions or protect against metal toxicity. This review focuses on the mechanisms metallo-regulators use to up- and down-regulate gene expression.
17707693	A light load eccentric exercise confers protection against a subsequent bout of more demanding eccentric exercise.	This study investigated the hypothesis that a light eccentric exercise (ECC) that does not induce a loss of muscle function and delayed onset muscle soreness would confer a protective effect against a more strenuous ECC. Eighteen young men were randomly placed into two groups: 10-40% (n=9) and 40% (n=9). Subjects in the 10-40% group performed ECC of the elbow flexors (six sets of five reps) using a dumbbell set at 10% of maximal isometric strength (MVC) at an elbow joint angle of 90 degrees , followed 2 days later by ECC using a dumbbell weight of 40% MVC. Subjects in the 40% group performed the 40% ECC only. Changes in MVC, range of motion (ROM), upper arm circumference (CIR), plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity and muscle soreness before, immediately after, 1-5 and 7 days following the 40% ECC were compared between groups by a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. No significant changes in any of the criterion measures were found immediately and 1-2 days after the 10% ECC. Following the 40% ECC, the 10-40% group showed significantly (P<0.05) smaller decreases in MVC and ROM, and smaller increases in muscle soreness compared with the 40% group, but no significant differences between groups were evident for CIR and plasma CK activity. These results suggest that the 10% ECC induced some protection against a subsequent bout of 40% ECC performed 2 days later. It appears that the light eccentric exercise preconditioned the muscles for exposure to the subsequent damaging eccentric exercise bout.
17707704	22q11 Deletion in children with cleft lip and palate--is routine screening justified?	OBJECTIVE: To ascertain the prevalence of 22q11 deletion in children with a diagnosis of cleft lip and/or palate that had been referred to the Cleft Lip & Palate Service, Newcastle-upon-Tyne. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of results of 22q11 FISH testing performed in all such referrals. PARTICIPANTS: 191 children, of whom 13 had a bilateral cleft lip and palate, two had a median cleft, 77 had a cleft palate only, 44 had a unilateral cleft lip, 47 had a unilateral cleft lip and palate and eight had a submucous cleft palate. RESULTS: nine patients had a positive 22q11 FISH test. CONCLUSION: This represents a higher percentage than has been previously reported. All children with cleft lip and/or palate should routinely have a 22q11 FISH test in view of the implications of a diagnosis of velocardiofacial syndrome.
17708513	Improved accuracy when screening for human growth disorders by likelihood ratios.	The standard deviation score (SDS) is a powerful tool for screening for growth-related problems. However, referral rules of the type 'if SDS(Y)<d, then refer' (for some constant d) are not optimal for answering the question: 'Does this child with measurement Y belong to the reference or to the diseased population?'. If the growth standard for the diseased population is known, then the likelihood ratio (LR) and the log-likelihood ratio (LLR) can be calculated for individual measurements. Rules of the type 'if LLR(Y)<e, then refer' are uniformly the most powerful test for any constant e, implying that their receiver operating characteristic curves are above those for all other possible tests based on Y. As an empirical demonstration, both types of rules are applied to longitudinal growth data comparing a group with diagnosed Turner syndrome and a reference group from birth to 10 years of age. Conforming with theory, the LR rules were found to be superior to the SDS rules in terms of sensitivity and specificity. We conclude that the LR is the natural measure for two-group studies that can be easily calculated for individual measurements. The LR is firmly rooted within both statistical and decision theory and can be used to estimate the absolute probability of disease.
17709102	The effect of generalized discriminate analysis (GDA) to the classification of optic nerve disease from VEP signals.	In this paper, we have investigated the effect of generalized discriminate analysis (GDA) on classification performance of optic nerve disease from visual evoke potentials (VEP) signals. The GDA method has been used as a pre-processing step prior to the classification process of optic nerve disease. The proposed method consists of two parts. First, GDA has been used as pre-processing to increase the distinguishing of optic nerve disease from VEP signals. Second, we have used the C4.5 decision tree classifier, Levenberg Marquart (LM) back propagation algorithm, artificial immune recognition system (AIRS), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. Without GDA, we have obtained 84.37%, 93.75%, 75%, 76.56%, and 53.125% classification accuracies using C4.5 decision tree classifier, LM back propagation algorithm, AIRS, LDA, and SVM algorithms, respectively. With GDA, 93.75%, 93.86%, 81.25%, 93.75%, and 93.75% classification accuracies have been obtained using the above algorithms, respectively. These results show that the GDA pre-processing method has produced very promising results in diagnosis of optic nerve disease from VEP signals.
17709108	High gametocyte complexity and mosquito infectivity of Plasmodium falciparum in the Gambia.	The purpose of this work was to determine the infectivity to mosquitoes of genetically diverse Plasmodium falciparum clones seen in natural infections in the Gambia. Two principal questions were addressed: (i) how infectious are gametocytes of sub-patent infections, particularly at the end of the dry season; and (ii) are all clones in multiclonal infections equally capable of infecting mosquitoes? The work was carried out with two cohorts of infected individuals. Firstly, a group of 31 P. falciparum-infected people were recruited in the middle of the dry season (May, 2003), then examined for P. falciparum at the beginning (August 2003) and middle (October, 2003) of the transmission season. On each occasion, we examined the genotypes of asexual forms and gametocytes by PCR and RT-PCR, as well as their infectivity to Anopheles gambiae using membrane feeds. One individual gave rise to infected mosquitoes in May, and two in August. Different gametocyte genotypes co-existed in the same infection and fluctuated over time. The mean multiplicity of infection was 1.4, 1.7 and 1.5 clones in May, August and October, respectively. Second, a group of patients undergoing drug-treatment during August 2003 was tested for asexual and gametocyte genotypes and their infectivity to mosquitoes. Forty-three out of 100 feeds produced infections. The genetic complexity of the parasites in mosquitoes was sometimes greater than that detectable in the blood on which the mosquitoes had fed. This suggested that gametocytes of clones existing in the blood below PCR detection limits at the time of the feed were at least as infectious to the mosquitoes as the more abundant clones. These findings emphasise the crucial role of gametocyte complexity and infectivity in generating the remarkable diversity of P. falciparum genotypes seen in infected people, even in an area of seasonal transmission.
17709607	Scavenger receptor class-A is a novel cell surface receptor for double-stranded RNA.	Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is a potent signal to the host immune system for the presence of an ongoing viral infection. The presence of dsRNA, intracellularly or extracellularly, leads to the induction of innate inflammatory cytokines in many cell types including epithelial cells. However, the cell surface receptor for recognition of extracellular dsRNA is not yet determined. Here, we report that extracellular dsRNA is recognized and internalized by scavenger receptor class-A (SR-A). Treatment of human epithelial cells with specific antagonists of SR-A or with an anti-SR-A antibody significantly inhibited dsRNA induction of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and regulated on activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES). Furthermore, intranasal dsRNA treatment of SR-A-deficient (SR-A(-/-)) mice showed a significant decrease in the expression of inflammatory cytokines and a corresponding decrease in the accumulation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) in lungs. These data provide direct evidence that SR-A is a novel cell surface receptor for dsRNA, and therefore, SR-A may play a role in antiviral immune responses.
17710352	Characteristics of patients initiating teriparatide for the treatment of osteoporosis.	UNLABELLED: The demographic and clinical characteristics of patients initiating teriparatide were compared with those of patients initiating bisphosphonates for the treatment of osteoporosis. In these samples of commercially insured, Medicare, and Medicaid patients, patients initiating teriparatide were older, in poorer health, and appeared to have more severe osteoporosis than patients initiating bisphosphonates. INTRODUCTION: The demographic and clinical characteristics of patients initiating teriparatide are compared with those of patients initiating bisphosphonates. METHODS: Beneficiaries (45 years and older) with at least one claim for teriparatide or a bisphosphonate from 2003 to 2005 and continuous enrollment in the previous 12 months and subsequent 6 months were identified from commercial, Medicare, and Medicaid administrative claims databases. Patients initiating teriparatide (commercial/Medicare (N = 2,218); Medicaid (N = 824)) were compared to patients initiating bisphosphonates (commercial/Medicare (N = 97,570); Medicaid (N = 77,526)) in terms of age, provider specialty, comorbidities, prior use of osteoporosis medications, fractures, BMD screening, health status, and resource utilization. RESULTS: Teriparatide patients were older and in poorer health than bisphosphonate patients. Approximately 38% of teriparatide patients in both groups had fractured in the pre-period compared to 16% of commercial/Medicare and 15% of Medicaid bisphosphonate patients. Teriparatide patients were more likely to have used osteoporosis medications in the pre-period (79.9% versus 32.1% (commercial/Medicare); 82.2% versus 19.6% (Medicaid)). CONCLUSIONS: In these samples of patients, those initiating teriparatide differed from those initiating bisphosphonates. Teriparatide patients were older, in poorer health, and appeared to have more severe osteoporosis than bisphosphonate patients. Comparisons of treatment outcomes should take these differences in patient characteristics into consideration.
17710362	Human amniotic fluid stem cells: a new perspective.	The discovery of amniotic fluid stem cells initiated a new and very promising field in stem cell research. In the last four years amniotic fluid stem cells have been shown to express markers specific to pluripotent stem cells, such as Oct-4. Due to their high proliferation potential, amniotic fluid stem cell lineages can be established. Meanwhile, they have been shown to harbor the potential to differentiate into cells of all three embryonic germ layers. It will be a major aim for the future to define the potential of this new source of stem cells for therapies related to specific diseases.
17710400	In vitro cross-resistance to nucleoside analogues and inhibitors of topoisomerase 1 and 2 in acute myeloid leukemia.	Only about one third of all patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) will be cured by common chemotherapy regimens. Susceptibility towards chemotherapy either of the leukemic bulk or the leukemic stem cell is considered the major determining parameter for long-term outcome. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether chemoresistance was correlated between different antileukemic drugs or not. We determined the lethal concentration of chemotherapy necessary to reduce viability of cells to 50% compared to untreated control (LC50) as a surrogate marker of chemotherapy susceptibility of six established chemotherapeutic agents [cytarabine (median 0.83 microg/ml), daunorubicine (0.09 microg/ml), idarubicine (0.03 microg/ml), mitoxantrone (0.05 microg/ml), etoposide (4.81 microg/ml), and topotecan (0.14 microg/ml)] in an overall number of 147 samples from consecutive patients with AML by WST-1 assay in vitro. We found that susceptibility to chemotherapy was significantly correlated between all six agents (all p values < 0.01). A homogenous response of the blast populations was significantly correlated to high chemoresistance. These data indicate that cross-resistance in AML against antileukemic drugs exists between agents with different modes of action and seems not to be mediated by drug-specific resistance mechanisms but rather by more generalized death-defying features of the affected cells (e.g., inhibited apoptosis).
17710487	Effectiveness of endoscopic surgery training for medical students using a virtual reality simulator versus a box trainer: a randomized controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: The first step toward increasing the level of patient safety in endoscopic surgery is for all endoscopic surgeons to acquire fundamental skills, including psychomotor skills, in the preoperation stage of training. The current study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of virtual reality (VR) simulator training and box training for training the fundamental skills of endoscopic surgery. METHODS: For this study, 35 medical students at Kyushu University were divided into three groups: simulator (SIM) group (n = 20), box trainer (BOX) group (n = 20), and control group (n = 15). None of the students had any experience assisting with endoscopic surgery or any previous training for endoscopic surgery. The students in the SIM group underwent training using a VR simulator, the Procedicus MIST, 2 h per day for 2 days. The students in the BOX group underwent training using a box trainer 2 h per day for 2 days. The students in the control group watched an educational video for 30 min. The endoscopic surgical skills of all the students were evaluated before and after training with a task of suturing and knot tying using a box trainer. RESULTS: Although no significant differences were found between the three groups in the total time taken to complete the evaluation task before training, there were significant improvements in the SIM and BOX groups after training compared with the control group. Box training increased errors during the task, but simulator training did not. CONCLUSION: The findings showed that box training and VR training have different outcomes. The authors expect that the best curriculum for their training center would involve a combination that uses the merits of both methods.
17710553	Molecular modeling on pyruvate phosphate dikinase of Entamoeba histolytica and in silico virtual screening for novel inhibitors.	Pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK) is the key enzyme essential for the glycolytic pathway in most common and perilous parasite Entamoeba histolytica. Inhibiting the function of this enzyme could control the wide spread of intestinal infections caused by Entamoeba histolytica in humans. With this objective, we modeled the three dimensional structure of the PPDK protein. We used templates with 51% identity and 67% similarity to employ homology-modeling approach. Stereo chemical quality of protein structure was validated by protein structure validation program PROCHECK and VERIFY3D. Experimental proof available in literature along with the in silico studies indicated Lys21, Arg91, Asp323, Glu325 and Gln337 to be the probable active sites in the target protein. Virtual screening was carried out using the genetic docking algorithm GOLD and a consensus scoring function X-Score to substantiate the prediction. The small molecule libraries (ChemDivision database, Diversity dataset, Kinase inhibitor database) were used for screening process. Along with the high scoring results, the interaction studies provided promising ligands for future experimental screening to inhibit the function of PPDK in Entamoeba histolytica. Further, the phylogeny study was carried out to assess the possibility of using the proposed ligands as inhibitors in related pathogens.
17711323	The standard protein mix database: a diverse data set to assist in the production of improved Peptide and protein identification software tools.	Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is frequently used in the identification of peptides and proteins. Typical proteomic experiments rely on algorithms such as SEQUEST and MASCOT to compare thousands of tandem mass spectra against the theoretical fragment ion spectra of peptides in a database. The probabilities that these spectrum-to-sequence assignments are correct can be determined by statistical software such as PeptideProphet or through estimations based on reverse or decoy databases. However, many of the software applications that assign probabilities for MS/MS spectra to sequence matches were developed using training data sets from 3D ion-trap mass spectrometers. Given the variety of types of mass spectrometers that have become commercially available over the last 5 years, we sought to generate a data set of reference data covering multiple instrumentation platforms to facilitate both the refinement of existing computational approaches and the development of novel software tools. We analyzed the proteolytic peptides in a mixture of tryptic digests of 18 proteins, named the "ISB standard protein mix", using 8 different mass spectrometers. These include linear and 3D ion traps, two quadrupole time-of-flight platforms (qq-TOF), and two MALDI-TOF-TOF platforms. The resulting data set, which has been named the Standard Protein Mix Database, consists of over 1.1 million spectra in 150+ replicate runs on the mass spectrometers. The data were inspected for quality of separation and searched using SEQUEST. All data, including the native raw instrument and mzXML formats and the PeptideProphet validated peptide assignments, are available at http://regis-web.systemsbiology.net/PublicDatasets/.
17711606	Dose form modification - a common but potentially hazardous practice. A literature review and study of medication administration to older psychiatric inpatients.	BACKGROUND: Many older patients have difficulty in swallowing their tablets and capsules. Dose form modification, by crushing tablets or opening capsules, is often used by nurses to administer such medication. METHODS: Electronic searches of five literature databases on tablet crushing and capsule opening were carried out. A review of medication incident reports involving tablet crushing from the U.K. National Reporting and Learning System (NRLS) was also undertaken. An observational study of medication administration on two long-stay wards for older mentally ill inpatients was carried out in a large psychiatric hospital. RESULTS: Only 17 incidents involving tablet crushing were reported to NRLS in 13 months. In the observational study, the administration of 1257 oral doses of medication at 36 medication rounds was observed. Tablets were crushed or capsules opened for 25.5% (266/1045) of solid oral doses. For 44.0% (117/266) of these doses the tablet crushing had not been authorized by the prescriber. For 4.5% (12/266) of doses crushing was specifically contra-indicated by the manufacturer. In 57.5% (153/266) of doses, tablet crushing was avoidable by the correct use of more suitable preparations. Crushing caused contamination, spillage and hygiene problems. CONCLUSIONS: Although tablet crushing and capsule opening are common practices, they are rarely reported as causing patient harm. Tablet crushing can often be avoided by the use of more suitable preparations. Crushing tablets and opening capsules are contra-indicated for some preparations. Older patients' medication may benefit from review by a pharmacist in order to optimize safe medication administration. Where tablet crushing is unavoidable, attention to cleanliness, contamination and spillage are necessary.
17713854	Effects of Nigella sativa and its major constituent, thymoquinone on sciatic nerves in experimental diabetic neuropathy.	The aim of this study was designed to investigate the possible beneficial effects of Nigella sativa (NS) and thymoquinone (TQ) on histopathological changes of sciatic nerves in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. The rats were randomly allotted into one of four experimental groups: A (control), B (diabetic untreated), C (diabetic treated with NS) and D (diabetic treated with TQ); each group contain ten animals. B, C and D groups received streptozotocin (STZ) to induce diabetes. The rats in NS and TQ treated groups were given NS (in a dose of 400 mg/kg body weight) and TQ (50 mg/kg body weight) once a day orally by using intra-gastric intubation for 12 weeks starting 2 days after STZ injection, respectively. Blood and tissue samples were obtained for biochemical and histopathological investigation. The treatment of both NS and TQ caused a sharp decrease in the elevated serum glucose (P < 0.01, 0.05, respectively), and an increase in the lowered serum insulin concentrations (P < 0.01, 0.05, respectively), in STZ-induced diabetic rats. STZ induced a significant decrease in the area of insulin immunoreactive beta-cells (P < 0.0001). NS (P < 0.001) and TQ (P < 0.01) treatment resulted in increased area of insulin immunoreactive beta-cells significantly. To date, no histopathological changes of sciatic nerves in STZ induced diabetic rats by NS and TQ treatment have been reported. In this study, histologic evaluation of the tissues in diabetic animals treated with TQ and especially NS showed fewer morphologic alterations. Myelin breakdown decreased significantly after treatment with NS and TQ. The ultrastructural features of axons also showed remarkable improvement. We believe that further preclinical research into the utility of NS and TQ may indicate its usefulness as a potential treatment on peripheral neuropathy (PN) in STZ induced diabetic rats.
17713858	Cytogenetic analysis of four species of Pseudis (Anura, Hylidae), with the description of ZZ/ZW sex chromosomes in P. tocantins.	Pseudis paradoxa paradoxa, P. p. platensis, P. bolbodactyla, P. fusca and P. tocantins were analyzed cytogenetically by conventional chromosomal staining, C-banding, silver staining and fluorescent in situ hybridization with an rDNA probe. Pseudis tocantins chromosomes were also stained with distamycin A/DAPI. All of the species had a diploid number of 2n = 24 chromosomes and the nucleolar organizer region (NOR) was located on pair 7. However, the karyotypes could be differentiated based on the morphology of chromosomal pairs 2 and 8, the region that the NORs occupied on the long arms of the homologous of pair 7, and the pattern of heterochromatin distribution. The subspecies P. p. paradoxa and P. p. platensis had identical karyotypes. Heteromorphism in NOR size was seen in P. p. paradoxa, P. p. platensis, P. bolbodactyla and P. fusca. Heteromorphic sex chromosomes (ZZ/ZW) were identified in P. tocantins. The W chromosome was subtelocentric and larger than the metacentric Z chromosomes. The differences observed in the C-banding pattern and in the position of the NOR on the sex chromosomes suggested that inversions and heterochromatinization were responsible for the morphological differentiation of these chromosomes.
17714782	High incidence of tuberculosis after alemtuzumab treatment in Hong Kong Chinese patients.	Twenty-seven patients received the anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody alemtuzumab for hematologic malignancies and autoimmune cytopenias in a tuberculosis-endemic area. Seven patients developed mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) infections (median: 4, 1-24, months from alemtuzumab). The actuarial 1- and 2-year incidence of TB was 31% and 45%. All patients had severe depression of lymphocyte counts subsequent to alemtuzumab treatment, and tuberculosis was extra-pulmonary in three cases. All seven patients had received prior chemotherapy/immunosuppression and tuberculosis had not occurred until alemtuzumab was administered. Patients receiving alemtuzumab in areas endemic for tuberculosis should have careful initial evaluation of TB exposure, so that prophylactic antibiotics might be administered. Tuberculosis reactivation should be considered for unexplained fever and symptoms after alemtuzumab treatment.
17716835	Prevalence and genetic profiles of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli strains isolated from buffaloes, cattle, and goats in central Vietnam.	We investigated the prevalence of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) in 568 healthy domestic animals (buffaloes, cattle, and goats) from 98 farms in the central region of Vietnam. The aims of this study were to determine if the prevalence of STEC in South East Asia is similar to that in other parts of the world, to characterize the virulence gene profiles from the recovered STEC and to determine if the recovered STEC belong to serotypes commonly associated with human disease. STEC and intimin-positive strains were recovered from 27% of buffaloes, 23% of cattle, and 38.5% of goats. Seventy percent of buffalo farms, 60% of cattle farms and 100% goat farms were positive for STEC. Of 170 STEC strains, 99 carried both stx1 and stx2 genes, 36 carried the stx2 gene, and 35 carried the stx1 gene. The eae gene was found in six caprine isolates, but not in buffalo or bovine isolates. Among 173 E. coli strains (170 STEC and 3 intimin-positive), 110 carried the ehxA gene, 106 possessed the saa gene. Further characterization of stx subtypes demonstrated that among 134 stx1-containing isolates, 107 belonged to the stx1c subtype and 27 were the stx1 subtype. Of the 132 stx2-containing isolates, 36 were stx2, 34 were stx2c, 43 were stx2d subtype, 3 belonged to stx2g, and 16 strains were stx2d(act). The stx2c variant was dominant in strains isolated from buffalo while the stx2d variant occurred more frequently in caprine isolates. Only 9 (5%) STEC strains contained genes encoding for serotypes O26, O91, O121, O145, and O157 LPS, which are more frequently associated with human infections. The results of this study provide data for understanding of epidemiology of STEC among domestic animals in Vietnam and indicate that buffaloes are also an important reservoir of STEC.
17716863	Epac-selective cAMP analogs: new tools with which to evaluate the signal transduction properties of cAMP-regulated guanine nucleotide exchange factors.	The identification of 2'-O-methyl substituted adenosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) analogs that activate the Epac family of cAMP-regulated guanine nucleotide exchange factors (cAMP-GEFs, also known as Epac1 and Epac2), has ushered in a new era of cyclic nucleotide research in which previously unrecognized signalling properties of the second messenger cAMP have been revealed. These Epac-Selective Cyclic AMP Analogs (ESCAs) incorporate a 2'-O-methyl substitution on the ribose ring of cAMP, a modification that impairs their ability to activate protein kinase A (PKA), while leaving intact their ability to activate Epac (the Exchange Protein directly Activated by Cyclic AMP). One such ESCA in wide-spread use is 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP. It is a cell-permeant derivative of 2'-O-Me-cAMP, and it is a super activator of Epac. A wealth of newly published studies demonstrate that 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP is a unique tool with which to asses atypical actions of cAMP that are PKA-independent. Particularly intriguing are recent reports demonstrating that ESCAs reproduce the PKA-independent actions of ligands known to stimulate Class I (Family A) and Class II (Family B) GTP-binding protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This topical review summarizes the current state of knowledge regarding the molecular pharmacology and signal transduction properties of Epac-selective cAMP analogs. Special attention is focused on the rational drug design of ESCAs in order to improve their Epac selectivity, membrane permeability, and stability. Also emphasized is the usefulness of ESCAs as new tools with which to assess the role of Epac as a determinant of intracellular Ca2+ signalling, ion channel function, neurotransmitter release, and hormone secretion.
17716957	Fission yeast Swi5 protein, a novel DNA recombination mediator.	The Schizosaccharomyces pombe Swi5 protein forms two distinct protein complexes, Swi5-Sfr1 and Swi5-Swi2, each of which plays an important role in the related but functionally distinct processes of homologous recombination and mating-type switching, respectively. The Swi5-Sfr1 mediator complex has been shown to associate with the two RecA-like recombinases, Rhp51 (spRad51) and Dmc1, and to stimulate in vitro DNA strand exchange reactions mediated by these proteins. Genetic analysis indicates that Swi5-Sfr1 works independently of another mediator complex, Rhp55-Rhp57, during Rhp51-dependent recombinational repair. In addition, mutations affecting the two mediators generate distinct repair spectra of HO endonuclease-induced DNA double strand breaks, suggesting that these recombination mediators differently regulate recombination outcomes in an independent manner.
17717663	CD8+ T cells against multiple tumor-associated antigens in peripheral blood of midgut carcinoid patients.	PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to identify immunogenic HLA-A*0201-binding epitopes derived from a number of classical midgut carcinoid-associated proteins. CD8(+) T cells recognizing tumor-associated antigen (TAA) epitopes are of great interest for the establishment of immunotherapy as a novel treatment for this type of malignancy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Midgut carcinoid tumor specimens were microdissected and expression levels of potential TAAs were investigated by quantitative real time PCR. HLA-A*0201-binding motifs were selected using HLA peptide binding prediction algorithms and stabilization of HLA-A*0201 was verified using TAP-deficient T2 cells. Peripheral blood of midgut carcinoid patients was analyzed for peptide epitope recognition and the feasibility of generating peptide-reactive CD8(+) T cells in healthy blood donors was examined by an in vitro stimulation protocol using mature DCs. Activation of patient and healthy donor CD8(+) T cells was analyzed by intracellular flow cytometry staining of interferon gamma. RESULTS: Chromogranin A (CGA), tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH-1), vesicular monoamine transporter 1 (VMAT-1), caudal type homeobox transcription factor 2 (CDX-2), and islet autoantigen 2 (IA-2) are properly expressed by midgut carcinoid tumor cells, with CGA mRNA expressed to greatest level. Midgut carcinoid patients have increased frequencies of peripheral blood CD8(+) T cells recognizing a pool of HLA-A*0201 peptides derived from these proteins compared to healthy age-matched individuals. Activated peptide-specific CD8(+) T cells could also be generated in healthy blood donors by in vitro stimulation. CONCLUSION: We have identified a number of immunogenic midgut carcinoid-associated peptide epitopes recognized by CD8(+) T cells. We show that midgut carcinoid patients display immune recognition of their tumors. Memory CD8(+) T cells in patient blood are of great interest when pursuing an immunotherapeutic treatment strategy.
17719274	Mechanisms of dendritic cell-based vaccination against infection.	Due to their unique capacity to initiate and regulate adaptive immune responses, dendritic cells (DC) represent the most potent antigen-presenting cells of the immune system. Immature DC reside in peripheral tissues, where they sample and process antigens and efficiently sense a large variety of signals from the surrounding environment. Toll-like receptors (TLR) expressed by DC play a critical role in the detection of invading pathogens as well as in triggering the subsequent immune responses. The differential expression of TLR by different DC subsets may correlate with the induction of different patterns of adaptive immune responses. The rapidly expanding and fundamental knowledge of DC biology furthers promising perspectives for the development of vaccination strategies in different fields. For example, the immunotherapeutic potential of antigen-pulsed DC for the treatment of cancer has been confirmed in a number of experimental tumour models. Furthermore, DC have been shown to serve as natural adjuvants in different models of infectious diseases, mediating protection against various types of pathogens. Using murine leishmaniasis as an example, we have demonstrated that DC, once properly conditioned ex vivo, mediate complete and durable protection against infection. Critical parameters determining the efficiency of DC-based vaccination against microbial pathogens include the origin of DC, the choice of antigen to be used for DC loading, the route of immunization and the state of DC maturation and activation. In the present review, we discuss the necessity to define the mechanisms responsible for the immunostimulatory capacity of DC in vivo, in order to exploit their full potential as vaccination tools.
17719279	Validation of the Italian version of the Cystic Fibrosis Quality of Life Questionnaire (CFQoL), a disease specific measure for adults and adolescents with cystic fibrosis.	BACKGROUND: Disease specific, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) measurement is important in cystic fibrosis (CF). This work aimed to translate the original English Cystic Fibrosis Quality of Life Questionnaire (CFQoL) into Italian, evaluate the linguistic translation and to psychometrically evaluate the Italian version of the CFQoL. METHODS: The linguistic translation followed the international guidelines of forward and backward translation. Psychometric evaluation of the Italian CFQoL involved the assessment of construct validity, internal reliability, concurrent validity, known groups validity and test-retest reliability. RESULTS: The instrument was acceptable to adolescents and adults with CF and demonstrated robust psychometric properties. Principle components analysis indicated that the factorial structure was essentially similar to the original, and the internal reliability of each domain was good (Cronbach alpha coefficients 0.73 to 0.91). Appropriate domains of the CFQoL and SF-36 correlated well indicating good concurrent validity (r=0.68-0.80). Consistent with theoretical expectations some domains were able to discriminate between disease severity groups. Test-retest reliability, assessed by intraclass correlation coefficients, was found to be excellent (ICC 0.83 to 0.98). CONCLUSIONS: The Italian CFQoL is a valid and reliable measure. Its use in individual patient monitoring and research should complement traditional clinical outcome measures.
17719558	Bringing order to a complex molecular machine: the assembly of the bacterial flagella.	The bacterial flagellum is an example of elegance in molecular engineering. Flagella dependent motility is a widespread and evolutionarily ancient trait. Diverse bacterial species have evolved unique structural adaptations enabling them to migrate in their environmental niche. Variability exists in the number, location and configuration of flagella, and reflects unique adaptations of the microorganism. The most detailed analysis of flagellar morphogenesis and structure has focused on Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica. The appendage assembles sequentially from the inner to the outer-most structures. Additionally the temporal order of gene expression correlates with the assembly order of encoded proteins into the final structure. The bacterial flagellar apparatus includes an essential basal body complex that comprises the export machinery required for assembly of the hook and flagellar filament. A review outlining the current understanding of the protein interactions that make up this remarkable structure will be presented, and the associated temporal genetic regulation will be briefly discussed.
17720336	High Mycobacterium bovis genetic diversity in a low prevalence setting.	The genetic diversity among South African Mycobacterium bovis isolates from cattle was determined by genetic fingerprinting. The restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers IS6110 and polymorphic GC-rich sequence (PGRS) as well as spoligotyping and determination of variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) were used to characterize sub samples of 91 M. bovis field isolates. PGRS RFLP was the single most discriminatory method and combinations of typing methods, which included IS6110 and/or PGRS had the highest discriminatory power, able to reveal 29 distinct genotypes among 35 farms with no epidemiological link. Three of the farms were co-infected with two genetically unrelated strains. In contrast to reports from European and also other colonised countries on the African continent our findings are suggestive of a high genetic diversity of M. bovis in South Africa's cattle population, implying a variety of unrelated ancestor strains. Despite effective intervention through test-and-slaughter campaigns no indication of a 'founder effect' was apparent in the panel of isolates derived from all infected provinces.
17720536	Classification of cryo-electron sub-tomograms using constrained correlation.	Cryo-electron tomography (CET) is currently the only three-dimensional imaging technique capable of visualizing macromolecules in their cellular context at close-to-native conditions with a resolution in the nanometer range. An important component for the analysis of the data is their classification, which should discriminate among various macromolecules, conformational changes and interaction partners. Missing structure factors, typically in a wedge-shaped region in Fourier space if single-axis tilting is performed, hamper classification of cryo-electron tomographic data. Here, we describe a classification method for three-dimensional (3D) sub-tomograms extracted from cryo-electron tomograms, which takes the missing wedge into account and provides reliable results. The similarity of the individually aligned sub-tomograms is scored by constrained correlation. Subsequently, they are clustered based on their pairwise correlation values. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, we apply the proposed method to simulated tomographic data of the chaperone thermosome in different conformations. By comparison of the principal components of the resulting matrix we show that the proposed metric is significantly less prone to the orientation of the missing wedge compared to the unconstrained correlation. Moreover, we apply our classification method to an experimental dataset of GroEL with and without GroES, where we achieve a distinct discrimination between the putative GroEL and GroEL/GroES complexes.
17723239	Absorption of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons to cellulose.	Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are widespread toxic chemicals. The environmental fate of these chemicals is in part controlled by sorption to (organic matter in) sediments and soils. One of the most abundant organic matter compounds on earth is cellulose. Remarkably, sorption of PAHs to cellulose has hardly been studied; only two reports on the binding of some low-molecular-weight PAHs exist in the literature. In this study, sorption of PAHs to cellulose was investigated in more detail, by measuring isotherms for a series of 13 PAHs, covering a wide hydrophobicity range. The results indicated that sorption of PAHs to cellulose is a linear partition process for all PAHs investigated (phenanthrene-indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene). The affinity of PAHs for cellulose appeared to be about 400 times lower than for octanol and even up to 300000 times lower than for black carbon or coal. Linked to the estimated yearly production of cellulose and black carbon, these results suggest that cellulose is probably not a major environmental sorption domain for PAHs.
17728019	Attracting students to aged care: the impact of a supportive orientation.	INTRODUCTION: The 'Building connections in aged care' project sought to investigate quality clinical placements for undergraduate nursing students in residential aged care facilities in Tasmania, Australia. BACKGROUND: Aged care reportedly holds little attraction to student nurses as an employment option, exacerbating problems with recruiting staff into the sector. This, coupled with knowing the quality of an undergraduate learning experience can influence career choices, provided the impetus for the study. METHODS: Informed by action research and conducted in three-stages, the project scoped the problem, implemented improvement strategies and assessed sustainability of their effectiveness. Data were collected via structured research meetings and surveys/check lists, and subjected to qualitative and quantitative analysis. RESULTS: A key finding was the importance of providing students with a comprehensive orientation to the aged care environment. DISCUSSION: The critical nature of orientation processes in the establishment of a supportive and welcoming environment for students, and to 'setting up' a positive and enjoyable learning experience in aged care settings has not been shown by research to date. CONCLUSION: Student orientation warrants greater attention. We recommend strategies concerning the structure of student orientation programs, links with university schools of nursing, use of preceptors, and preparing aged care facility staff.
17729272	Mutagenesis study of rice nonspecific lipid transfer protein 2 reveals residues that contribute to structure and ligand binding.	Plant nonspecific lipid transfer protein 2 (nsLTP2) is a small (7 kDa) protein that binds lipid-like ligands. An inner hydrophobic cavity surrounded by alpha-helices is the defining structural feature of nsLTP2. Although nsLTP2 structures have been reported earlier, the detailed mechanisms of ligand binding and lipid transfer remain unclear. In this study, we used site-directed mutagenesis to determine the role of various hydrophobic residues (L8, I15, F36, F39, Y45, Y48, and V49) in the structure, stability, ligand binding, and lipid transfer activity of rice nsLTP2. Three single mutations (L8A, F36A, and V49A) drastically alter the native tertiary structure and perturb ligand binding and lipid transfer activity. Therefore, these three residues are structurally important. The Y45A mutant, however, retains a native-like structure but has decreased lipid binding affinity and lipid transfer activity, implying that this aromatic residue is critical for these biological functions. The mutants, I15A and Y48A, exhibit quite different ligand binding affinities. Y48 is involved in planar sterol binding but not linear lysophospholipid association. As for I15A, it had the highest dehydroergosterol binding affinity in spite of the lower lipid binding and transfer abilities. Our results suggest that the long alkyl side chain of I15 would restrict the flexibility of loop I (G13-A19) for sterol entry. Finally, F39A can markedly increase the exposed hydrophobic surface to maintain its transfer efficiency despite reduced ligand binding affinity. These findings suggest that the residues forming the hydrophobic cavity play various important roles in the structure and function of rice nsLTP2.
17729286	Loop modeling: Sampling, filtering, and scoring.	We describe a fast and accurate protocol, LoopBuilder, for the prediction of loop conformations in proteins. The procedure includes extensive sampling of backbone conformations, side chain addition, the use of a statistical potential to select a subset of these conformations, and, finally, an energy minimization and ranking with an all-atom force field. We find that the Direct Tweak algorithm used in the previously developed LOOPY program is successful in generating an ensemble of conformations that on average are closer to the native conformation than those generated by other methods. An important feature of Direct Tweak is that it checks for interactions between the loop and the rest of the protein during the loop closure process. DFIRE is found to be a particularly effective statistical potential that can bias conformation space toward conformations that are close to the native structure. Its application as a filter prior to a full molecular mechanics energy minimization both improves prediction accuracy and offers a significant savings in computer time. Final scoring is based on the OPLS/SBG-NP force field implemented in the PLOP program. The approach is also shown to be quite successful in predicting loop conformations for cases where the native side chain conformations are assumed to be unknown, suggesting that it will prove effective in real homology modeling applications.
17761738	European and US publications in the 50 highest ranking pathology journals from 2000 to 2006.	AIMS: To analyse the contributions of the 15 primary member states of the European Union and selected non-European countries to pathological research between 2000 and 2006. METHODS: Pathological journals were screened using ISI Web of Knowledge database. The number of publications and related impact factors were determined for each country. Relevant socioeconomic indicators were related to the scientific output. Subsequently, results were compared to publications in 10 of the leading biomedical journals. RESULTS: The research output remained generally stable. In Europe, the UK, Germany, France, Italy and Spain ranked top concerning contributions to publications and impact factors in the pathological and leading general biomedical journals. With regard to socioeconomic data, smaller, mainly northern European countries showed a relatively higher efficiency. Of the lager countries, the UK is the most efficient in that respect. The rising economic powers of China and India were consistently in the rear. CONCLUSIONS: Results mirror the leading role of the USA in pathology research but also show the relevance of European scientists. The scientometric approach in this study provides a new fundamental and comparative overview of pathology research in the European Union and the USA which could help to benchmark scientific output among countries.
17763453	Severe Guillain-Barré syndrome associated with chromosome 17p11.2-12 duplication.	We report a patient with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), characterized by severe tetraparesis, bulbar syndrome, and ophthalmoparesis. The nadir was reached within 1 day, followed by respiratory insufficiency requiring mechanical ventilation. Molecular analysis revealed a duplication at chromosome 17p11.2-12, which is a known genetic cause of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A). We suggest that this genotype may comprise a previously unrecognized genetic risk factor for GBS.
17763921	Rheumatoid arthritis, periodontal disease and coronary artery disease.	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), periodontal disease (PD), and coronary artery disease (CAD) are common chronic inflammatory diseases. RA is associated with accelerated vascular risk resulting in an increased prevalence of CAD with attendant early mortality and excess morbidity. RA and PD have a common pathobiology. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to evaluate the association between RA, PD, and CAD and the influence of systemic inflammatory factors. A total of 100 active RA patients of which 50 had established CAD and 50 had no CAD were assessed for PD. All subjects underwent a clinical, cardiac, dental, laboratory, and radiological evaluation. Blood samples were obtained, and the level of high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), total white blood counts (WBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), fibrinogen and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha, total cholesterol (TC), and high density lipoprotein (HDL) were assayed. The findings of this study demonstrated an association between RA, PD, and CAD. The RA patients with CAD had significantly more PD than RA patients without CAD. The inflammatory markers, hsCRP, ESR, WBC, fibrinogen, and TNF-alpha, were raised in all patients but were significantly higher in RA patients with CAD who also had PD. HDL levels were lower in RA patients with CAD when compared to RA patients without CAD. Evidence from this study shows an association between RA, PD, CAD, and systemic levels of the inflammatory mediators. The implication is that inflammation may be the central link between the chronic inflammatory, autoimmune disorders, and atherosclerosis.
17763959	Effect of adiponectin and ghrelin on apoptosis of Barrett adenocarcinoma cell line.	BACKGROUND: Obesity is an important risk factor for Barrett adenocarcinoma. However, the role of adiponectin (anti-inflammatory adipokine from adipose tissue) and ghrelin (orexigenic peptide gastric origin) on the progression of Barrett's carcinogenesis has not been investigated so far. The aim of the present study was: (1) to compare the expression of adiponectin and ghrelin receptors in Barrett's esophagus and in normal squamous epithelium; (2) to assess the effect of adiponectin and ghrelin on apoptosis in Barrett's adenocarcinoma cells in vitro; and (3) to investigate the effect of ghrelin on IL-1beta and COX-2 expression in OE-19 cells incubated with TNFalpha. METHODS: The expression of ghrelin and adiponectin receptors (GHS-R1a, Adipo-R1, Adipo R-2) in biopsies from Barrett's esophagus and in Barrett's adenocarcinoma cell line OE-19 was assessed by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). The OE-19 cells were also incubated with adiponectin (5-10 microg/ml), and the apoptosis and proliferation were assessed by FACS and MTT assays. Additionally, effects of adiponectin on the mRNA and protein expression of proapoptotic Bax and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 were assessed by RT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. In two different in vitro models of esophagitis the OE-19 cells were incubated with ghrelin alone or in the presence of TNFalpha or bile acids in the normal or pulse acidified medium, and the expression of IL-1beta and COX-2 as markers for inflammation were assessed by FACS and qRT-PCR, respectively. RESULTS: Adiponectin caused a significant increase in apoptosis, and this affect was accompanied by increased Bax and decreased Bcl-2 expression. In contrast, ghrelin had no effect on apoptosis of OE-19 cells incubated in neutral or acidified medium with or without addition of deoxycholic acid. At the mRNA level, the expression of adiponectin receptors (Adipo-R1, Adipo-R2) was decreased, and the expression of ghrelin receptor (GHS-R1a) was increased in Barrett's mucosa. Ghrelin caused a decrease in TNFalpha-induced COX-2 and IL-1beta expression in OE-19 cells. CONCLUSION: Adiponectin and ghrelin have an inhibitory effect on Barrett's carcinogenesis by two different mechanisms: (1) by an increase in apoptosis by adiponectin, and (2) by anti-inflammatory actions of ghrelin. The decrease in levels of these two peptides in obesity may explain the progression of Barrett's carcinoma in obese individuals.
17766092	Anemonin is a natural bioactive compound that can regulate tyrosinase-related proteins and mRNA in human melanocytes.	BACKGROUND: Melanin is the pigment responsible for skin color. Melanin synthesis occurs with the participation of the tyrosinase (TYR) family of proteins including TYR, tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TRP1), and tyrosinase-related protein 2(TRP2/DCT). OBJECTIVE: The effect of a newly isolated natural compound that inhibits hyperpigmentation on the regulation of the TYR family of proteins was examined. METHODS: The natural compound, anemonin, was isolated from Clematis crassifolia Benth and was used to inhibit cellular TYR activity; it was found to have a low cytotoxicity (cell viability > 80%) in human melanocytes. RESULTS: In human melanocytes, anemonin showed both time- and dose-dependent inhibition (IC(50) 43.5 microM) of TYR. Western blot analysis and immunocytochemical staining revealed that expression of TYR, TRP1, and TRP2 was decreased in anemonin-treated melanocytes. Additionally, reverse transcription and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses revealed that expression of mRNAs for MITF, TYR, TYRP1, and TYRP2 was also suppressed by anemonin. CONCLUSION: The natural compound, anemonin, an active compound of C. crassifolia, inhibits pigmentation synthesis in human melanocytes. Anemonin inhibits melanin synthesis by inhibiting the transcription of the genes encoding MITF, TYR, TRP1, and TRP2. This natural compound may be a candidate for cosmetic use.
17766271	AWTY (are we there yet?): a system for graphical exploration of MCMC convergence in Bayesian phylogenetics.	UNLABELLED: A key element to a successful Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inference is the programming and run performance of the Markov chain. However, the explicit use of quality assessments of the MCMC simulations-convergence diagnostics-in phylogenetics is still uncommon. Here, we present a simple tool that uses the output from MCMC simulations and visualizes a number of properties of primary interest in a Bayesian phylogenetic analysis, such as convergence rates of posterior split probabilities and branch lengths. Graphical exploration of the output from phylogenetic MCMC simulations gives intuitive and often crucial information on the success and reliability of the analysis. The tool presented here complements convergence diagnostics already available in other software packages primarily designed for other applications of MCMC. Importantly, the common practice of using trace-plots of a single parameter or summary statistic, such as the likelihood score of sampled trees, can be misleading for assessing the success of a phylogenetic MCMC simulation.

17767940	The effect of chronic alcohol consumption on mitochondrial DNA mutagenesis in human blood.	The 4977bp deletion of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is known to accumulate with increasing age in post mitotic tissues. Recently, studies came out detecting this specific alteration also in fast replicating cells, e.g. in blood or skin tissue, often in correlation to specific diseases or -- specifically in skin -- external stressors such as UV radiation. In this study, we investigated mitochondrial mutagenesis in 69 patients with a chronic alcoholic disease and 46 age matched controls with a moderate drinking behavior. Two different fragments, specific for total and for deleted mtDNA (dmtDNA) were amplified in a duplex-PCR. A subsequent fragment analysis was performed and for relative quantification, the quotient of the peak areas of amplification products specific for deleted and total mtDNA was determined. Additionally, a real time PCR was performed to quantify mtDNA copy number. The relative amount of 4977bp deleted mtDNA in alcoholics was significantly increased compared to controls. On the other hand, no difference regarding the mtDNA/nuclear DNA ratio in both investigated groups was detected. Additionally, no age dependence could be found nor in alcoholics, neither in the control group. These findings indicate that mtDNA mutagenesis in blood can be influenced by stressors such as alcohol. Ethanol seems to be a significant factor to alter mitochondrial DNA in blood and might be an additional contributor for the cellular aging process.
17768015	Predictors of distant brain recurrence for patients with newly diagnosed brain metastases treated with stereotactic radiosurgery alone.	PURPOSE: To ascertain predictors of distant brain failure (DBF) in patients treated initially with stereotactic radiosurgery alone for newly diagnosed brain metastases. We hypothesize that these factors may be used to group patients according to risk of DBF. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We retrospectively analyzed 100 patients with newly diagnosed brain metastases treated from 2003 to 2005 at our Gamma Knife radiosurgery facility. The primary endpoint was DBF. Potential predictors included number of metastases, tumor volume, histologic characteristics, extracranial disease, and use of temozolomide. RESULTS: One-year actuarial risk of DBF was 61% for all patients. Significant predictors of DBF included more than three metastases (hazard ratio, 3.30; p = 0.004), stable or poorly controlled extracranial disease (hazard ratio, 2.16; p = 0.04), and melanoma histologic characteristics (hazard ratio, 2.14; p = 0.02). These were confirmed in multivariate analysis. Those with three or fewer metastases, no extracranial disease, and nonmelanoma histologic characteristics (N = 18) had a median time to DBF of 89 weeks vs. 33 weeks for all others. One-year actuarial freedom from DBF for this group was 83% vs. 26% for all others. CONCLUSIONS: Independent significant predictors of DBF in our series included number of metastases (more than three), present or uncontrolled extracranial disease, and melanoma histologic characteristics. These factors were combined to identify a lower risk subgroup with significantly longer time to DBF. These patients may be candidates for initial localized treatment, reserving whole-brain radiation therapy for salvage. Patients in the higher risk group may be candidates for initial whole-brain radiation therapy or should be considered for clinical trials.
17784924	The nature of fisheries- and farming-induced evolution.	Humans have a penchant for unintentionally selecting against that which they desire most. In fishes, unprecedented reductions in abundance have been associated with unprecedented changes in harvesting and aquaculture technologies. Fishing, the predominant cause of fish-population collapses, is increasingly believed to generate evolutionary changes to characters of import to individual fitness, population persistence and levels of sustainable yield. Human-induced genetic change to wild populations can also result from interactions with their domesticated counterparts. Our examination of fisheries- and farming-induced evolution includes factors that may influence the magnitude, rate and reversibility of genetic responses, the potential for shifts in reaction norms and reduced plasticity, loss of genetic variability, outbreeding depression and their demographic consequences to wild fishes. We also suggest management initiatives to mitigate the effects of fisheries- and farming-induced evolution. Ultimately, the question of whether fishing or fish farming can cause evolutionary change is moot. The key issue is whether such change is likely to have negative conservation- or socio-economic consequences. Although the study of human-induced evolution on fishes should continue to include estimates of the magnitude and rate of selection, there is a critical need for research that addresses short- and long-term demographic consequences to population persistence, plasticity, recovery and productivity.
17785683	Identification of genes involved in the toxic response of Saccharomyces cerevisiae against iron and copper overload by parallel analysis of deletion mutants.	Iron and copper are essential nutrients for life as they are required for the function of many proteins but can be toxic if present in excess. Accumulation of these metals in the human body as a consequence of overload disorders and/or high environmental exposures has detrimental effects on health. The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an accepted cellular model for iron and copper metabolism in humans primarily because of the high degree of conservation between pathways and proteins involved. Here we report a systematic screen using yeast deletion mutants to identify genes involved in the toxic response to growth-inhibitory concentrations of iron and copper sulfate. We aimed to understand the cellular responses to toxic concentrations of these two metals by analyzing the different subnetworks and biological processes significantly enriched with these genes. Our results indicate the presence of two different detoxification pathways for iron and copper that converge toward the vacuole. The product of several of the identified genes in these pathways form molecular complexes that are conserved in mammals and include the retromer, endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) and AP-3 complexes, suggesting that the mechanisms involved can be extrapolated to humans. Our data also suggest a disruption in ion homeostasis and, in particular, of iron after copper exposure. Moreover, the identification of treatment-specific genes associated with biological processes such as DNA double-strand break repair for iron and tryptophan biosynthesis for copper suggests differences in the mechanisms by which these two metals are toxic at high concentrations.
17786573	In vitro wounding: effects of hypoxia and transforming growth factor beta1 on proliferation, migration and myofibroblastic differentiation in an endothelial cell-fibroblast co-culture model.	The adequate reconstitution of human soft tissue wounds requires the coordinated interaction of endothelial cells and fibroblasts during the proliferation phase of healing. Endothelial cells assure neoangiogenesis, fibroblasts fill the defect and provide extracellular matrix proteins, and myofibroblasts are believed to support the reconstitution of microvessels. In the present study, we combined in vitro-wound size measurement and multicolour immunocytochemical staining of co-cultured human dermal microvascular endothelial cells and normal human dermal fibroblasts, recently introduced as co-culture scratch-wound migration assay. Applying antibodies for alpha-smooth-muscle actin, von Willebrand factor, extra domain A fibronectin and endothelin-1, we were able to monitor proliferation, migration and the differentiation process from fibroblasts to myofibroblasts as a response to hypoxia. Furthermore, we verified, whether transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFbeta1) and endothelin-1 are able to mediate this response. We show, that proliferation and migration of endothelial cells and fibroblasts decreased under hypoxia. The additional administration of TGFbeta1 did not significantly attenuate this decrease. Solely the myofibroblast population in co-culture adapted well to hypoxia, when cultures were supplemented with TGFbeta1. Considerating the data concerning TGFbeta1 and endothelin-1, we propose a model explaining the cellular interaction during early and late proliferation phase of human wound healing.
17803456	Decline and conservation of bumble bees.	Declines in bumble bee species in the past 60 years are well documented in Europe, where they are driven primarily by habitat loss and declines in floral abundance and diversity resulting from agricultural intensification. Impacts of habitat degradation and fragmentation are likely to be compounded by the social nature of bumble bees and their largely monogamous breeding system, which renders their effective population size low. Hence, populations are susceptible to stochastic extinction events and inbreeding. In North America, catastrophic declines of some bumble bee species since the 1990s are probably attributable to the accidental introduction of a nonnative parasite from Europe, a result of global trade in domesticated bumble bee colonies used for pollination of greenhouse crops. Given the importance of bumble bees as pollinators of crops and wildflowers, steps must be taken to prevent further declines. Suggested measures include tight regulation of commercial bumble bee use and targeted use of environmentally comparable schemes to enhance floristic diversity in agricultural landscapes.
17804161	Recovery of Cu(II) and Cd(II) by a chelating resin containing aspartate groups.	A chelating resin, crosslinked poly(glycidyl methacrylate-aspartic acid) (PASP), was synthesized by anchoring sodium aspartate to crosslinked poly(glycidyl methacrylate) for the recovery of Cu2+ and Cd2+ from aqueous solutions. The resin was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope and mass balance. In non-competitive conditions, the adsorptions tended toward equilibrium at 60 min and the equilibrium adsorption capacities were 1.40 and 1.28 mmol/gPASP for Cu2+ and Cd2+, respectively. The adsorption isothermals of the metal ions by PASP followed the Freundlich isotherm. Adsorption of Cu2+ was affected slightly in the presence of NaNO3 (0-0.3M) but the uptake of Cd2+ decreased significantly in the same condition. Except pH> or =4.0, the adsorption capacity of each metal ion decreased with lowering of solution pH. The reusability of PASP in adsorptions was investigated for five successive adsorption-desorption operations. When the pH of Cu2+/Cd2+ mixture was 2 or 2.5, the competitive adsorption tests confirmed this resin had good adsorption selectivity for Cu2+ with the coexistence of Cd2+.
17804216	Yield enhancement strategies for artemisinin production by suspension cultures of Artemisia annua.	Artemisinin, isolated from the shrub-Artemisia annua, is a sesquiterpene lactone used to treat multi-drug resistant strains of falciparum malaria. It is also effective against a wide variety of cancers such as leukemia and colon cancer. To counter the present low content in leaves and uneconomical chemical synthesis, alternate ways to produce artemisinin have been sought. But this compound remains elusive in cell cultures of A. annua despite the extensive studies undertaken. This work reports the first successful approach for production of artemisinin by cell cultures of Indian variety of A. annua. In the present study, an integrated yield enhancement strategy, developed by addition of selected precursor (mevalonic acid lactone) and elicitor (methyl jasmonate) at optimized concentrations, resulted in 15.2g/l biomass and 110.2mg/l artemisinin, which was 5.93 times higher in productivity in comparison to control cultures.
17804267	Recent advances in the development of recombinant vaccines against classical swine fever virus: cellular responses also play a role in protection.	Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) is the causative agent of one of the most devastating porcine haemorrhagic viral diseases, classical swine fever (CSF). CSFV mainly infects endothelial cells and macrophages and at the same time promotes bystander apoptosis of the surrounding T cells, causing strong immune suppression and high mortality rates. Most animals experience acute infection, during which they either die or survive by producing neutralising antibodies to the virus. However, in a few cases, the impaired immune system cannot control viral progression, leading to chronic infection. Efficient live attenuated vaccines against CSFV exist and are routinely used only in endemic countries. The ability of these vaccines to replicate in the host, even at very low rates, makes it extremely difficult to distinguish vaccinated from infected animals, favouring a restricted policy regarding vaccination against CSFV in non-endemic countries. There is a clear need for efficient and safer marker vaccines to assist in the control of future CSF outbreaks. In this review article, some of the most recent advances in the field of recombinant vaccines against CSFV are presented and the nature of the protective immune responses they induce is discussed.
17804591	Day-care management of severe and very severe pneumonia, without associated co-morbidities such as severe malnutrition, in an urban health clinic in Dhaka, Bangladesh.	BACKGROUND: Management of severe and very severe pneumonia in children relies on hospital-based treatment, but practical barriers often prevent children in areas with the highest rates from receiving hospital care. OBJECTIVE: To develop and prospectively evaluate a day-care clinic approach, which provided antibiotics, feeding and supportive care during the day with continued care provided by parents at home, as an effective alternative to hospitalisation. METHODS: Children aged 2-59 months with severe or very severe pneumonia without associated co-morbidities, denied admission to hospital because of lack of beds, were enrolled at Radda Clinic, Dhaka and received antibiotics, feeding and supportive care from 08:00 to 17:00 every day, while mothers were educated on continuation of care at home during the night. RESULTS: From June 2003 to May 2005, 251 children were enrolled. Severe and very severe pneumonia was present in 189 (75%) and 62 (25%) children, respectively, and 143 (57%) were hypoxaemic with a mean (SD) oxygen saturation of 93 (4)%, which increased to 98 (3)% on oxygen therapy. The mean (SD) day-care period was 7 (2) days. Successful management was possible in 234 children (93% (95% CI 89% to 96%)), but 11 (4.4% (95% CI 2.5% to 7.7%)) had to be referred to hospital, and six (2.4% (95% CI 1.1% to 5.1%)) discontinued treatment. There were no deaths during the day-care study period; however, four children (1.6% (95% CI 0.6% to 4.0%)) died during the 3-month follow-up period, and 11 (4.4% (95% CI 2.5% to 7.7%)) required hospital admission. CONCLUSION: Severe and very severe pneumonia in children without associated co-morbidities such as severe malnutrition can be successfully managed at day-care clinics.
17805918	Responses of microbial communities in Arctic sea ice after contamination by crude petroleum oil.	Microbial communities associated with Arctic fjord ice polluted with petroleum oils were investigated in this study. A winter field experiment was conducted in the Van Mijen Fjord (Svalbard) from February to June 2004, in which the ice was contaminated with a North Sea paraffinic oil. Holes were drilled in the ice and oil samples frozen into the ice at the start of the experiment. Samples, including cores of both oil-contaminated and clean ice, were collected from the field site 33, 74, and 112 days after oil application. The sampled cores were separated into three sections and processed for microbiological and chemical analyses. In the oil-contaminated cores, enumerations of total prokaryotic cells by fluorescence microscopy and colony-forming units (CFU) counts of heterotrophic prokaryotes both showed stimulation of microbial growth, while concentrations of oil-degrading prokaryotes remained at similar levels in contaminated and clean ice. Analysis of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified bacterial 16S rRNA gene fragments by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) revealed that bacterial communities in oil-contaminated ice generated fewer bands than communities in clean ice, although banding patterns changed both in contaminated and clean ice during the experimental period. Microbial communities in unpolluted ice and in cores contaminated with the paraffinic oil were examined by cloning and sequence analysis. In the contaminated cores, the communities became predominated by Gammaproteobacteria related to the genera Colwellia, Marinomonas, and Glaciecola, while clean ice included more heterogeneous populations. Chemical analysis of the oil-contaminated ice cores with determinations of n-C17/Pristane and naphthalene/phenanthrene ratios indicated slow oil biodegradation in the ice, primarily in the deeper parts of the ice with low hydrocarbon concentrations.
17823855	Enzymatic deconstruction of backbone structures of the ramified regions in pectins.	The pectic enzymes are a diverse group of enzymes that collectively degrade pectin, a mixture of highly heterogeneous and branched polysaccharides rich in D: -galacturonic acids forming a major component of the primary cell wall of plants. This review covers key enzymes that function to deconstruct the "ramified region" of pectin. The enzymes include glycoside hydrolases and polysaccharide lyases that degrade complex pectic domains consisting of rhamnogalacturonans, xylogalacturonans, and other heterogeneous polymers. The chemical nature of the pectic substrates for the enzymes is presented. The biochemical properties of the enzymes, the mechanisms of enzyme actions, and related structures and functions, are described. Applications of these enzymes in fruit juice processing and in the production of bioactive compounds, as well as their technological relevance to the deconstruction of cell wall structures for biomass conversion are discussed.
17825127	Risk factors for suicide in China's youth: a case-control study.	BACKGROUND: Suicide is the most common cause of death among youth in China. METHOD: A case-control psychological autopsy study in 23 geographically representative disease surveillance points around China collected information from family members and close associates of 114 persons aged 15-24 years who died by suicide (cases) and 91 who died of other injuries (controls). RESULTS: Among the 114 suicides 61% were female, 88% lived in rural villages, 70% died by ingesting pesticides (most commonly stored in the home), 24% previously attempted suicide, and 45% met criteria of a mental illness at the time of death. Multivariate logistic regression identified several independent risk factors: severe life events within 2 days before death (OR 31.8, 95% CI 2.6-390.6), presence of any depressive symptoms within 2 weeks of death (OR 21.1, 95% CI 4.6-97.2), low quality of life in the month before death (OR 9.7, 95% CI 2.8-34.1), and acute stress at time of death (moderate: OR 3.1, 95% CI 0.8-11.9; high: OR 9.1, 95% CI 1.2-66.8). A significant interaction between mental illness at time of death and gender indicated that diagnosis was an important predictor of suicide in males (OR 14.0, 95% CI 2.6-76.5) but not in females (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.0-3.6). Prior suicide attempt was related to suicide in the univariate analysis (OR 57.5) but could not be included in the multivariate model because no controls had made prior attempts. CONCLUSIONS: Suicide prevention efforts for youth in China must focus on restricting access to pesticides, early recognition and management of depressive symptoms and mental illnesses, improving resiliency, and enhancing quality of life.
17825470	Dyskeratosis congenita: the diverse clinical presentation of mutations in the telomerase complex.	Dyskeratosis congenita is an inherited syndrome characterised by mucocutaneous features, bone marrow failure, an increased risk of malignancy and other somatic abnormalities. There is a considerable range of clinical severity and in its occult form the disease may present as idiopathic aplastic anaemia. Genes responsible for X-linked, autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive forms of the disease have been identified and been found to encode products involved in telomere maintenance. Premature shortening of telomeres could account for the pathology, affecting the tissues that turn over most rapidly. However, the protein that is mutated in the X-linked disease, dyskerin, also plays a fundamental role in ribosome biogenesis, directing the pseudouridylation of ribosomal RNA using H/ACA small nucleolar RNAs as guides. Heterozygous mutations in the RNA component of telomerase (TERC) cause the autosomal dominant form of the disease through haploinsufficiency. Disease anticipation described in these families is associated with progressive telomere shortening through the generations. Heterozygous mutations in the reverse transcriptase component of telomerase (TERT) have a more variable role, often displaying incomplete penetrance and diverse clinical presentation. The autosomal recessive form of the disease is genetically heterogeneous, although one sub-type has been described in which NOP10 is mutated. This small protein is also associated with the maturation of ribosomal RNA and the telomerase complex.
17826300	Mutual paracrine effects of oral squamous cell carcinoma cells and normal oral fibroblasts: induction of fibroblast to myofibroblast transdifferentiation and modulation of tumor cell proliferation.	Several lines of evidence demonstrated that the stroma surrounding the tumors plays an important role in the growth and progression of several neoplasms, including oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC). We evaluated the presence of myofibroblasts in OSCC and determined whether their presence is associated with clinicopathological features of the tumors. We also investigated the mutual paracrine effects of tumor cells and myofibroblasts on fibroblast-myofibroblast transdifferentiation and tumor cell proliferation. Immunohistochemical analysis showed the approximately 60% of the OSCCs contained myofibroblasts in the stroma of the tumor. Abundant presence of myofibroblasts significantly correlated with N stage, disease stage, regional recurrence, and proliferative potential of the tumor cells. Using OSCC cell lines and primary oral normal fibroblasts (ONF), we demonstrated that tumor cells induced transdifferentiation of ONFs to myofibroblasts via secretion of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1). In turn, myofibroblasts secreted factors that stimulated OSCC cell proliferation, as revealed by measuring BrdU incorporation and Ki67 expression. The results of the study suggest that during tumor invasion OSCC-derived TGF-beta 1 promote fibroblast-myofibroblast transdifferentiation, and that tumor cellular proliferation can be induced by factors released from myofibroblasts, which may favor tumor growth.
17826728	BMP15 mutations in XX gonadal dysgenesis and premature ovarian failure.	OBJECTIVE: Premature ovarian failure (POF) is a heterogeneous group of diseases with amenorrhea before the age of 40 years and elevated gonadotropins. Recently, heterozygous mutations in the X-linked gene encoding bone morphogenetic protein-15 (BMP15) have been identified as a possible cause of ovarian failure. STUDY DESIGN: Molecular analysis of BMP15, growth differentiation factor-9 (GDF9), and follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) in patients with ovarian failure. RESULTS: We can show that a BMP15 alteration, previously described as a mutation, is instead a polymorphism. A digenic inheritance of POF including BMP15 and FSHR is unlikely. Mutations in GDF9 could not be detected. CONCLUSION: Caution is recommended in the interpretation of BMP15 mutations in the context of POF.
17826865	PEG-uricase in the management of treatment-resistant gout and hyperuricemia.	Hyperuricemia results from an imbalance between the rates of production and excretion of uric acid. Longstanding hyperuricemia can lead to gout, which is characterized by the deposition of monosodium urate monohydrate crystals in the joints and periarticular structures. Because such deposits are resolved very slowly by lowering plasma urate with available drugs or other measures, the symptoms of gout may become chronic. Persistent hyperuricemia may also increase the risk of renal and cardiovascular diseases. Unlike most mammals, humans lack the enzyme uricase (urate oxidase) that catalyzes the oxidation of uric acid to a more soluble product. This review describes the development of a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) conjugate of recombinant porcine-like uricase with which a substantial and persistent reduction of plasma urate concentrations has been demonstrated in a Phase 2 clinical trial. Two ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials include systematic assessments of gout symptoms, tophus resolution and quality of life, in addition to the primary endpoint of reduced plasma urate concentration.
17827023	Scanning electron microscopy studies of antennal sensilla of Pteromalus cerealellae (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae).	Pteromalus cerealellae (Ashmead) (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae) is an ectoparasitoid of several insect pests of stored products. In order to provide requisite background information to support our ongoing research on its host location mechanisms, we examined the external morphology of the antennal sensilla of this parasitoid using scanning electron microscopy. Antennae of male and female P. cerealellae are geniculate in shape, approximately 1300mum in length, and consist of 15 antennomeres. Eight morphological sensilla types were recorded in both sexes, including four types of the highly abundant and widely distributed sensilla trichodea (types I, II and IV are aporous while type III is multiporous), basiconic capitate peg sensilla, coeloconic sensilla, chaetica sensilla, and the most conspicuous plate-like placoid sensilla. Detailed examination of sensilla morphological features including pore presence and numbers suggest that the multiporous type III sensilla trichodea and the multiporous placoid sensilla may play a role in olfaction, whereas the uniporous chaetica sensilla may function as contact chemoreceptors. The types I and II sensilla trichodea are presumably mechanosensory, while the type IV sensilla trichodea may function as proprioceptors. The basiconic capitate peg sensilla and coeloconic sensilla probably function in thermo-hygro reception. Although the shape, structure, and size of antennae of males and female were basically similar, major differences were recorded between the sexes in the distribution of some sensilla types. The type II sensilla trichodea and the multiporous placoid sensilla are relatively more abundant in females, whereas males have greater number of the multiporous type III sensilla trichodea than females. These results are discussed in relation to the possible roles of the sensilla types in the host location behavior of P. cerealellae.
17827407	Apple procyanidins induce tumor cell apoptosis through mitochondrial pathway activation of caspase-3.	Various epidemiologic and experimental in vivo and in vitro studies have suggested that polyphenols derived from fruits, vegetables and beverages might decrease the risk of developing lifestyle diseases, such as cardiovascular disorders and cancer. Apples are a major dietary source of polyphenols. Here we investigated the antitumor activity of apple polyphenols (APs) and procyanidins, namely condensed tannins, both in vitro and in vivo studies. APs and procyanidins inhibited the growth of transplanted B16 mouse melanoma cells and BALB-MC.E12 mouse mammary tumor cells, and increased the survival rate of the host mice-transplanted B16 cells. Among the APs, the apple procyanidins specifically, rather than other polyphenols such as chlorogenic acid, (-)-epicatechin, phloridzin and procyanidin B2, had a major effect on cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in vitro. The apple procyanidins increased mitochondrial membrane permeability and cytochrome c release from mitochondria and activated caspase-3 and caspase-9 within the tumor cells. In addition, we separated eight procyanidin fractions according to the degree of polymerization using normal-phase chromatography, and detected strong anti-tumor activity in the procyanidin pentamer and higher degree fractions. Our results indicate that the oral administration of apple procyanidins inhibits the proliferation of tumor cells by inducing apoptosis through the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway.
17828384	New fossil ants in French Cretaceous amber (Hymenoptera: Formicidae).	Recent studies on the ant phylogeny are mainly based on the molecular analyses of extant subfamilies and do not include the extinct, only Cretaceous subfamily Sphecomyrminae. However, the latter is of major importance for ant relationships, as it is considered the most basal subfamily. Therefore, each new discovery of a Mesozoic ant is of high interest for improving our understanding of their early history and basal relationships. In this paper, a new sphecomyrmine ant, allied to the Burmese amber genus Haidomyrmex, is described from mid-Cretaceous amber of France as Haidomyrmodes mammuthus gen. and sp. n. The diagnosis of the tribe Haidomyrmecini is emended based on the new type material, which includes a gyne (alate female) and two incomplete workers. The genus Sphecomyrmodes, hitherto known by a single species from Burmese amber, is also reported and a new species described as S. occidentalis sp. n. after two workers remarkably preserved in a single piece of Early Cenomanian French amber. The new fossils provide additional information on early ant diversity and relationships and demonstrate that the monophyly of the Sphecomyrminae, as currently defined, is still weakly supported.
17828788	Recurrent salivary gland carcinomas treated by surgery with or without intraoperative radiation therapy.	BACKGROUND: The optimal treatment for patients with locally recurrent carcinomas of the salivary glands is unclear. METHODS: Ninety-nine patients underwent salvage surgery for locally recurrent salivary gland carcinomas. Eighty-one (82%) had previously received radiation. Thirty-seven patients (37%) received intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) to a median dose of 15 Gy (range, 12-18 Gy) at the time of salvage. RESULTS: The 1-, 3-, and 5-year estimates of local control after salvage surgery were 88%, 75%, and 69%, respectively. A Cox proportional hazard model identified positive margins (0.01) and the omission of IORT (p = .001) as independent predictors of local failure. The 5-year overall survival was 34%. Distant metastasis was the most common site of subsequent failure, occurring in 42% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: IORT significantly improves disease control for patients with locally recurrent carcinomas of the salivary glands. The high rate of distant metastasis emphasizes the need for effective systemic therapies.
17846768	In vivo amyloid imaging with PET in frontotemporal dementia.	BACKGROUND: N-methyl[11C]2-(4'methylaminophenyl)-6-hydroxy-benzothiazole (PIB) is a positron emission tomography (PET) tracer with amyloid binding properties which allows in vivo measurement of cerebral amyloid load in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a syndrome that can be clinically difficult to distinguish from AD, but in FTD amyloid deposition is not a characteristic pathological finding. PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to investigate PIB retention in FTD. METHODS: Ten patients with the diagnosis of FTD participated. The diagnosis was based on clinical and neuropsychological examination, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scan, and PET with 18 Fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (FDG). The PIB retention, measured in regions of interest, was normalised to a reference region (cerebellum). The results were compared with PIB retention data previously obtained from 17 AD patients with positive PIB retention and eight healthy controls (HC) with negative PIB retention. Statistical analysis was performed with a students t-test with significance level set to 0.00625 after Bonferroni correction. RESULTS: Eight FTD patients showed significantly lower PIB retention compared to AD in frontal (p < 0.0001), parietal (p < 0.0001), temporal (p = 0.0001), and occipital (p = 0.0003) cortices as well as in putamina (p < 0.0001). The PIB uptake in these FTD patients did not differ significantly from the HC in any region. However, two of the 10 FTD patients showed PIB retention similar to AD patients. CONCLUSION: The majority of FTD patients displayed no PIB retention. Thus, PIB could potentially aid in differentiating between FTD and AD.
17847078	Presynaptic evidence for zinc release at the mossy fiber synapse of rat hippocampus.	Vesicular zinc (Zn(2+)) is found in a subset of glutamatergic nerve terminals throughout the mammalian forebrain and is colocalized with glutamate. Despite well-documented neuromodulatory roles, exocytosis of endogenous Zn(2+) from presynaptic terminals has never been directly demonstrated, because existing studies have measured elevated Zn(2+) concentrations by examining the perfusate. Thus, the specific origin of synaptic Zn(2+) remains a controversial subject. Here, we describe synaptic Zn(2+) trafficking between cellular compartments at hippocampal mossy fiber synapses by using the fluorescent indicator Zinpyr-1 to label the hippocampal mossy fiber boutons. We determined endogenous Zn(2+) exocytosis by direct observation of vesicular Zn(2+) as decreasing fluorescence intensity from presynaptic axonal boutons in the stratum lucidum of CA3 during neural activities induced by the stimulation of membrane depolarization. This presynaptic fluorescence gradually returned to a level near baseline after the withdrawal of moderate stimulation, indicating an endogenous mechanism to replenish vesicular Zn(2+). The exocytosis of the synaptic Zn(2+) was also dependent on extracellular Ca(2+) and was sensitive to Zn(2+)-specific chelators. Vesicular Zn(2+) loading was sensitive to the vacuolar-type H(+)-ATPase inhibitor concanamycin A, and our experiments indicated that blockade of vesicular reloading with concanamycin A led to a depletion of that synaptic Zn(2+). Furthermore, synaptic Zn(2+) translocated to the postsynaptic cell body upon release to produce increases in the concentration of weakly bound Zn(2+) within the postsynaptic cytosol, demonstrating a feature unique to ionic substances released during neurotransmission. Our data provide important evidence for Zn(2+) as a substance that undergoes release in a manner similar to common neurotransmitters.
17847091	Native atomic burials, supplemented by physically motivated hydrogen bond constraints, contain sufficient information to determine the tertiary structure of small globular proteins.	We investigate the possibility that atomic burials, as measured by their distances from the structural geometrical center, contain sufficient information to determine the tertiary structure of globular proteins. We report Monte Carlo simulated annealing results of all-atom hard-sphere models in continuous space for four small proteins: the all-beta WW-domain 1E0L, the alpha/beta protein-G 1IGD, the all-alpha engrailed homeo-domain 1ENH, and the alpha + beta engineered monomeric form of the Cro protein 1ORC. We used as energy function the sum over all atoms, labeled by i, of |R(i) - R(i) (*)|, where R(i) is the atomic distance from the center of coordinates, or central distance, and R(i) (*) is the "ideal" central distance obtained from the native structure. Hydrogen bonds were taken into consideration by the assignment of two ideal distances for backbone atoms forming hydrogen bonds in the native structure depending on the formation of a geometrically defined bond, independently of bond partner. Lowest energy final conformations turned out to be very similar to the native structure for the four proteins under investigation and a strong correlation was observed between energy and distance root mean square deviation (DRMS) from the native in the case of all-beta 1E0L and alpha/beta 1IGD. For all alpha 1ENH and alpha + beta 1ORC the overall correlation between energy and DRMS among final conformations was not as high because some trajectories resulted in high DRMS but low energy final conformations in which alpha-helices adopted a non-native mutual orientation. Comparison between central distances and actual accessible surface areas corroborated the implicit assumption of correlation between these two quantities. The Z-score obtained with this native-centric potential in the discrimination of native 1ORC from a set of random compact structures confirmed that it contains a much smaller amount of native information when compared to a traditional contact Go potential but indicated that simple sequence-dependent burial potentials still need some improvement in order to attain a similar discriminability. Taken together, our results suggest that central distances, in conjunction to physically motivated hydrogen bond constraints, contain sufficient information to determine the native conformation of these small proteins and that a solution to the folding problem for globular proteins could arise from sufficiently accurate burial predictions from sequence followed by minimization of a burial-dependent energy function.
17848620	Dual ITAM-mediated proteolytic pathways for irreversible inactivation of platelet receptors: de-ITAM-izing FcgammaRIIa.	Collagen binding to glycoprotein VI (GPVI) induces signals critical for platelet activation in thrombosis. Both ligand-induced GPVI signaling through its coassociated Fc-receptor gamma-chain (FcRgamma) immunoreceptor tyrosine-activation motif (ITAM) and the calmodulin inhibitor, W7, dissociate calmodulin from GPVI and induce metalloproteinase-mediated GPVI ectodomain shedding. We investigated whether signaling by another ITAM-bearing receptor on platelets, FcgammaRIIa, also down-regulates GPVI expression. Agonists that signal through FcgammaRIIa, the mAbs VM58 or 14A2, potently induced GPVI shedding, inhibitable by the metalloproteinase inhibitor, GM6001. Unexpectedly, FcgammaRIIa also underwent rapid proteolysis in platelets treated with agonists for FcgammaRIIa (VM58/14A2) or GPVI/FcRgamma (the snake toxin, convulxin), generating an approximate 30-kDa fragment. Immunoprecipitation/pull-down experiments showed that FcgammaRIIa also bound calmodulin and W7 induced FcgammaRIIa cleavage. However, unlike GPVI, the approximate 30-kDa FcgammaRIIa fragment remained platelet associated, and proteolysis was unaffected by GM6001 but was inhibited by a membrane-permeable calpain inhibitor, E64d; consistent with this, micro-calpain cleaved an FcgammaRIIa tail-fusion protein at (222)Lys/(223)Ala and (230)Gly/(231)Arg, upstream of the ITAM domain. These findings suggest simultaneous activation of distinct extracellular (metalloproteinase-mediated) and intracellular (calpain-mediated) proteolytic pathways irreversibly inactivating platelet GPVI/FcRgamma and FcgammaRIIa, respectively. Activation of both pathways was observed with immunoglobulin from patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), suggesting novel mechanisms for platelet dysfunction by FcgammaRIIa after immunologic insult.
17848915	Advances in behavioral genetics: mouse models of autism.	Autism is a neurodevelopmental syndrome with markedly high heritability. The diagnostic indicators of autism are core behavioral symptoms, rather than definitive neuropathological markers. Etiology is thought to involve complex, multigenic interactions and possible environmental contributions. In this review, we focus on genetic pathways with multiple members represented in autism candidate gene lists. Many of these pathways can also be impinged upon by environmental risk factors associated with the disorder. The mouse model system provides a method to experimentally manipulate candidate genes for autism susceptibility, and to use environmental challenges to drive aberrant gene expression and cell pathology early in development. Mouse models for fragile X syndrome, Rett syndrome and other disorders associated with autistic-like behavior have elucidated neuropathology that might underlie the autism phenotype, including abnormalities in synaptic plasticity. Mouse models have also been used to investigate the effects of alterations in signaling pathways on neuronal migration, neurotransmission and brain anatomy, relevant to findings in autistic populations. Advances have included the evaluation of mouse models with behavioral assays designed to reflect disease symptoms, including impaired social interaction, communication deficits and repetitive behaviors, and the symptom onset during the neonatal period. Research focusing on the effect of gene-by-gene interactions or genetic susceptibility to detrimental environmental challenges may further understanding of the complex etiology for autism.
17848917	Inducible expression of mutant human DISC1 in mice is associated with brain and behavioral abnormalities reminiscent of schizophrenia.	A strong candidate gene for schizophrenia and major mental disorders, disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) was first described in a large Scottish family in which a balanced chromosomal translocation segregates with schizophrenia and other psychiatric illnesses. The translocation mutation may result in loss of DISC1 function via haploinsufficiency or dominant-negative effects of a predicted mutant DISC1 truncated protein product. DISC1 has been implicated in neurodevelopment, including maturation of the cerebral cortex. To evaluate the neuronal and behavioral effects of mutant DISC1, the Tet-off system under the regulation of the CAMKII promoter was used to generate transgenic mice with inducible expression of mutant human DISC1 (hDISC1) limited to forebrain regions, including cerebral cortex, hippocampus and striatum. Expression of mutant hDISC1 was not associated with gross neurodevelopmental abnormalities, but led to a mild enlargement of the lateral ventricles and attenuation of neurite outgrowth in primary cortical neurons. These morphological changes were associated with decreased protein levels of endogenous mouse DISC1, LIS1 and SNAP-25. Compared to their sex-matched littermate controls, mutant hDISC1 transgenic male mice exhibited spontaneous hyperactivity in the open field and alterations in social interaction, and transgenic female mice showed deficient spatial memory. The results show that the neuronal and behavioral effects of mutant hDISC1 are consistent with a dominant-negative mechanism, and are similar to some features of schizophrenia. The present mouse model may facilitate the study of aspects of the pathogenesis of schizophrenia.
17849079	Patients with eating disorders and their siblings. An investigation of body image perceptions.	Little is known about body images of siblings of patients with eating disorders. In this study we investigated body images of patients with anorexia or bulimia nervosa and of the patients' brothers and sisters. A computer program was employed that allows modeling perceived and desired body images of patients and family members. Patients, siblings and male and female control subjects rated their body images. The selected images were compared with anthropometric data. All subjects also filled out a body image questionnaire. Data from 30 patients, 38 siblings, and 60 control subjects are presented. Siblings did not differ from healthy control subjects. Self-ideal discrepancy was different in patients with anorexia and their sisters. Body image was more negative in patients than in their sisters. Siblings of patients with eating disorders seem to be rather unimpaired in terms of body image disturbances.
17849084	Treatment and prognosis of brain metastases from breast cancer.	BACKGROUND: To analyze retrospectively the results of treatments for patients with brain metastases from breast cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The records of 65 breast cancer patients with brain metastases who were treated between 1985 and 2005 were reviewed. For brain metastases, 11 patients (17%) were treated with surgical resection followed by radiotherapy, and the remaining 54 patients were treated with radiotherapy alone. Systemic chemotherapy was also administered to 11 patients after brain radiotherapy. RESULTS: The overall median survival for all patients was 6.1 months (range, 0.4-82.2 months). In univariate analysis, treatment modality, Karnofsky performance status (KPS), administration of systemic chemotherapy, extracranial disease status and total radiation dose each had significant impact on overall survival, and in multivariate analysis, treatment modality, KPS and administration of systemic chemotherapy were significant prognostic factors. Eight patients survived for more than 2 years after the diagnosis of brain metastases, and all these patients were treated with surgical resection and/or systemic chemotherapy in addition to radiotherapy. For the 45 patients treated with palliative radiotherapy (without systemic chemotherapy), the improvements in neurological symptoms were observed in 35 patients (78%), with the median duration of improvement of 3.1 months (range, 1.5-4.4 months). CONCLUSIONS: The prognoses for patients with brain metastases from breast cancer were generally poor, although selected patients may survive longer with intensive brain tumor treatment, such as surgical resection and/or systemic chemotherapy in addition to brain radiotherapy. For patients with unfavorable prognoses, palliative radiotherapy was effective in improving the quality of the remaining lifetime.
17849183	Reliability and validity of the Chinese version of the Social Anxiety Scale for Adolescents.	This study evaluated the psychometric properties of the Chinese version of the Social Anxiety Scale for Adolescents (SAS-A) in a sample of 296 adolescents (49% boys) in Grades 7, 8, 9, 10, and 12 with a mean age of 15.52 years. Confirmatory factor analysis replicated the three-factor structure of the SAS-A in the Chinese sample: Fear of Negative Evaluation (FNE), Social Avoidance and Distress in New Situations (SAD-New), and Social Avoidance and Distress-General (SAD-General). Internal consistency and test-retest reliability were appropriate. The results also revealed a clear and predictable pattern of relationships between the SAS-A and the Questionnaire about Interpersonal Difficulties for Adolescents and the International Personality Item Pool. Chinese boys reported greater SAD-General than Chinese girls, and this difference increased with grade. The SAS-A scores were compared to previously collected data from the USA and Spain, revealing that Chinese adolescents scored significantly higher in social anxiety than American and Spanish adolescents.
17849373	Health-related quality of life among patients with adenocarcinoma of the gastro-oesophageal junction treated by gastrectomy or oesophagectomy.	BACKGROUND: Tumours of the gastro-oesophageal junction may be resected by total gastrectomy (TG) or transthoracic oesophagectomy (TTO). This study compared health-related quality of life (HRQL) following these procedures. METHODS: Prospective clinical and HRQL data (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30) were collected from 63 consecutive patients (20 TG and 43 TTO) before and 6 months after surgery for Siewert type I-III gastro-oesophageal tumours. RESULTS: Questionnaire response rates exceeded 90 per cent. Patients were similar with respect to disease stage, treatment-related mortality and survival, but those selected for TTO were younger with less co-morbidity than those undergoing TG. These differences were reflected in baseline HRQL scores, which were better in patients selected for TTO. Six months after surgery, however, HRQL showed a greater deterioration after TTO than after TG in terms of role and social function, global quality of life and fatigue. Symptom scores for pain and diarrhoea increased in both groups. CONCLUSION: TTO had a greater negative impact on HRQL than TG for tumours of the gastro-oesophageal junction.
17851735	Characterization of collagen II fibrils containing biglycan and their effect as a coating on osteoblast adhesion and proliferation.	Collagen has been used as a coating material for titanium-based implants for bone contact and as a component of scaffolds for bone tissue engineering. In general collagen type I has been used, however very little attention has been focussed on collagen type II. Collagen-based coatings and scaffolds have been enhanced by the incorporation of the glycosaminoglycan chondroitin sulphate (CS), however the proteglycan biglycan, which is found in bone and contains glycosaminoglycan chains consisting of CS, has not been used as a biomaterial component. The study had the following aims: firstly, five different collagen II preparations were compared with regard to their ability to bind CS and biglycan and the changes in fibril morphology thereby induced. Secondly, the effects of biglycan on the adhesion of primary rat osteoblasts (rO) as well as the proliferation of rO, primary human osteoblasts (hO) and the osteoblast-like cell line 7F2 were studied by culturing the cells on surfaces coated with collagen II fibrils containing biglycan. Fibrils of the collagen II preparation which bound the most biglycan were used to coat titanium surfaces. Bare titanium, titanium coated with collagen II fibrils and titanium coated with collagen II fibrils containing biglycan were compared. It was found that different collagen II preparations showed different affinities for CS and biglycan. In four of the five preparations tested, biglycan reduced fibril diameter, however the ability of a preparation to bind more biglycan did not appear to lead to a greater reduction in fibril diameter. Fibrils containing biglycan promoted the formation of focal adhesions by rO and significantly enhanced the proliferation of hO but not of rO or 7F2 cells. These results should encourage further investigation of biglycan as a component of collagen-based scaffolds and/or coatings.
17851740	Characterization of protein-protein interfaces.	We analyze the characteristics of protein-protein interfaces using the largest datasets available from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). We start with a comparison of interfaces with protein cores and non-interface surfaces. The results show that interfaces differ from protein cores and non-interface surfaces in residue composition, sequence entropy, and secondary structure. Since interfaces, protein cores, and non-interface surfaces have different solvent accessibilities, it is important to investigate whether the observed differences are due to the differences in solvent accessibility or differences in functionality. We separate out the effect of solvent accessibility by comparing interfaces with a set of residues having the same solvent accessibility as the interfaces. This strategy reveals residue distribution propensities that are not observable by comparing interfaces with protein cores and non-interface surfaces. Our conclusions are that there are larger numbers of hydrophobic residues, particularly aromatic residues, in interfaces, and the interactions apparently favored in interfaces include the opposite charge pairs and hydrophobic pairs. Surprisingly, Pro-Trp pairs are over represented in interfaces, presumably because of favorable geometries. The analysis is repeated using three datasets having different constraints on sequence similarity and structure quality. Consistent results are obtained across these datasets. We have also investigated separately the characteristics of heteromeric interfaces and homomeric interfaces.
17851763	The prevalence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutations in high-risk breast cancer patients of Chinese Han nationality: two recurrent mutations were identified.	To have an overview of the role of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes among Chinese high-risk breast cancer patients, we analyzed 489 such high-risk breast cancer patients from four breast disease clinical centers in China, by using PCR-DHPLC or SSCP-DNA sequencing analysis. Allelotype analysis was done at five short tandem repeat (STR) markers in or adjacent to BRCA1 on the recurrent mutation carriers. For those analyzed both genes, 8.7% of early-onset breast cancer cases and 12.9% of familial breast cancer cases had a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, as compared with the 26.1% of cases with both early-onset breast cancer and affected relatives. For those reporting malignancy family history other than breast/ovarian cancer, the prevalence of BRCA1/2 mutation is about 20.5%, and it was significantly higher than the patients only with family history of breast/ovarian cancer (P = 0.02). The family history of ovarian cancer (26.7% vs. 11.9%) and stomach cancer (23.8% vs. 11.8%) doubled the incidence of BRCA1/2, but the difference did not reach the statistical significance. Two recurrent mutations in BRCA1, 1100delAT and 5589del8, were identified. The recurrent mutations account for 34.8% BRCA1 mutations in our series. Similar allelotypes were detected in most STR status for those harboring the same mutations. The BRCA1 associated tumors were more likely to exhibit a high tumor grade, negative C-erbB-2/neu status and triple negative (ER, PgR and C-erbB-2/neu negative) status (P < 0.05). We recommended the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genetic analysis could be done for high-risk breast cancer patient in Chinese population, especially for those with both early-onset breast cancer and affected relatives. There may be some degree of shared ancestry for the two recurrent BRCA1 mutations in Chinese.
17854394	Frequent mutations of beta-catenin gene in sporadic secreting adrenocortical adenomas.	OBJECTIVE: Molecular alterations remain largely unknown in most sporadic adrenocortical tumours and hyperplasias. In our previous work, we demonstrated the differential expression of several Wnt/beta-catenin signalling-related genes implicated in ACTH-independent macronodular adrenal hyperplasias (AIMAH). To better understand the role of Wnt/beta-catenin signalling in adrenocortical tumours, we performed mutational analysis of the beta-catenin gene. METHODS: We studied 53 human adrenocortical samples (33 adenomas, 4 carcinomas, 13 AIMAH, 3 ACTH-dependent adrenal hyperplasias) and the human adrenocortical cancer cell line NCI-H295R. All samples were screened for somatic mutations in exons 3 and 5 of the beta-catenin gene. Eleven and six samples were analysed for beta-catenin protein expression by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry, respectively. RESULTS: No mutations were detected in adrenocortical carcinomas, AIMAH and ACTH-dependent hyperplasias. Genetic alterations were found in 5 (15%) out of 33 adenomas: three cortisol-secreting adenomas, one aldosterone-secreting adenoma and one nonfunctional adenoma. Two-point mutations occurred at serine residues of codons 37 and 45 (S37C and S45F). The remaining three tumours contained deletions of 6, 55 and 271 bp. H295R cells carry an activating S45P mutation. Western blot analysis of samples with 55- and 271-bp deletions showed an additional shorter and more intense band representing an accumulation of the mutated form of beta-catenin protein. In addition, cytoplasmic and/or nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin was observed in mutated adenomas by immunohistochemistry. CONCLUSIONS: Activating mutations of exon 3 of the beta-catenin gene are frequent in adrenocortical adenomas, and further characterization of the Wnt/beta-catenin signalling pathway should lead to a better understanding of adrenal tumourigenesis.
17854825	Natural occurrence of Beauveria bassiana in Hypothenemus hampei (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) populations in unsprayed coffee fields.	Three unsprayed coffee farms (farm 1, 2 and 3) were studied for the natural occurrence of the insect pathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana in Hypothenemus hampei populations throughout the rainy season of 2004 (July-November) and 2005 (July-December). B. bassiana infections were found during most sampling dates in both years, on all three farms. The B. bassiana infection levels were higher in 2005 than in 2004 with mean prevalence of 12.1% and 2.7%, respectively. No consistent significant differences in infection level between farms were found in any of the years. B. bassiana infection levels fluctuated widely throughout the season, and peaked at 13.5% on farm 3 in 2004 and at 44.0% on farm 1 in 2005. The H. hampei population was significantly higher in 2004 than in 2005, with 6.9% of the berries infested in 2004 and only 0.7% in 2005. In both years, the H. hampei infestation level was significantly higher on farm 2. No consistent significant differences in H. hampei infestation levels were found between sampling dates on any of the farms. H. hampei infestation levels fluctuated throughout both seasons, and peaked at 15.3% on farm 2 in 2004 and 2.2% on farm 2 in 2005. No consistent density dependent correlation between H. hampei infestation level and B. bassiana infection level was found. Correlations between climatic conditions and B. bassiana or H. hampei were not found.
17855124	Markov random field based automatic image alignment for electron tomography.	We present a method for automatic full-precision alignment of the images in a tomographic tilt series. Full-precision automatic alignment of cryo electron microscopy images has remained a difficult challenge to date, due to the limited electron dose and low image contrast. These facts lead to poor signal to noise ratio (SNR) in the images, which causes automatic feature trackers to generate errors, even with high contrast gold particles as fiducial features. To enable fully automatic alignment for full-precision reconstructions, we frame the problem probabilistically as finding the most likely particle tracks given a set of noisy images, using contextual information to make the solution more robust to the noise in each image. To solve this maximum likelihood problem, we use Markov Random Fields (MRF) to establish the correspondence of features in alignment and robust optimization for projection model estimation. The resulting algorithm, called Robust Alignment and Projection Estimation for Tomographic Reconstruction, or RAPTOR, has not needed any manual intervention for the difficult datasets we have tried, and has provided sub-pixel alignment that is as good as the manual approach by an expert user. We are able to automatically map complete and partial marker trajectories and thus obtain highly accurate image alignment. Our method has been applied to challenging cryo electron tomographic datasets with low SNR from intact bacterial cells, as well as several plastic section and X-ray datasets.
17855138	Purification and characterization of transducin from capybara Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris.	Polypeptides of approximately 39, 36 and <or= 14.4 kDa remained tightly bound to illuminated Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris retinal rod outer segment (ROS) membranes following extensive isotonic and hypotonic washes, and were specifically released in the presence of GTP. These results identified them as the alpha-, beta-and gamma-subunits of transducin (T). Once purified to homogeneity by anion-exchange chromatography, capybara T showed light-dependent beta,gamma-imido-guanosine 5'-triphosphate (GMPPNP) binding and GTPase activities in the presence of bovine rhodopsin, was recognized by anti-bovine T polyclonal antibodies, and was ADP-ribosylated by pertussis toxin. Capybara T bound GMPPNP with an apparent Kd of 18 nM, and the Scatchard and Hill plots revealed positive cooperativity for binding to photoactivated rhodopsin. Using a coupled enzymatic spectrophotometric assay, the initial velocity of its intrinsic light-dependent GTP hydrolytic capacity was calculated to be 0.1 mol of GTP hydrolyzed/min/mol of capybara T. Additionally, chromatography on omega-amino octylagarose of GTPgammaS-extracted capybara T demonstrated that this protein is composed by two functional units, the alpha-subunit and the betagamma-complex. All these results showed that capybara T possesses similar characteristics to other reported transducins. Interestingly, T is the first protein involved in phototransduction that is purified and characterized from H. hydrochaeris.
17855574	Molecular characterization of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and HIV-2 in Yaounde, Cameroon: evidence of major drug resistance mutations in newly diagnosed patients infected with subtypes other than subtype B.	Prior to current studies on the emergence of drug resistance with the introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Cameroon, we performed genotypic analysis on samples from drug-naïve, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals in this country. Of the 79 HIV type 1 (HIV-1) pol sequences analyzed from Cameroonian samples, 3 (3.8%) were identified as HIV-1 group O, 1 (1.2%) was identified as an HIV-2 intergroup B/A recombinant, and the remaining 75 (95.0%) were identified as HIV-1 group M. Group M isolates were further classified as subtypes A1 (n = 4), D (n = 4), F2 (n = 6), G (n = 12), H (n = 2), and K (n = 1) and as circulating recombinant forms CRF02_AG (n = 41), CRF11_cpx (n = 1), and CRF13_cpx (n = 2). Two pol sequences were identified as unique recombinant forms of CRF02_AG/F2 (n = 2). M46L (n = 2), a major resistance mutation associated with resistance to protease inhibitors, was observed in 2/75 (2.6%) group M samples. Single mutations associated with resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (T215Y/F [n = 3]) and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (V108I [n = 1], L100I [n = 1], and Y181C [n = 2]) were observed in 7 of 75 (9.3%) group M samples. None of the patients had any history of ART exposure. Population surveillance of transmitted HIV drug resistance is required and should be included to aid in the development of appropriate guidelines.
17855761	Human tendon behaviour and adaptation, in vivo.	Tendon properties contribute to the complex interaction of the central nervous system, muscle-tendon unit and bony structures to produce joint movement. Until recently limited information on human tendon behaviour in vivo was available; however, novel methodological advancements have enabled new insights to be gained in this area. The present review summarizes the progress made with respect to human tendon and aponeurosis function in vivo, and how tendons adapt to ageing, loading and unloading conditions. During low tensile loading or with passive lengthening not only the muscle is elongated, but also the tendon undergoes significant length changes, which may have implications for reflex responses. During active loading, the length change of the tendon far exceeds that of the aponeurosis, indicating that the aponeurosis may more effectively transfer force onto the tendon, which lengthens and stores elastic energy subsequently released during unloading, in a spring-like manner. In fact, data recently obtained in vivo confirm that, during walking, the human Achilles tendon provides elastic strain energy that can decrease the energy cost of locomotion. Also, new experimental evidence shows that, contrary to earlier beliefs, the metabolic activity in human tendon is remarkably high and this affords the tendon the ability to adapt to changing demands. With ageing and disuse there is a reduction in tendon stiffness, which can be mitigated with resistance exercises. Such adaptations seem advantageous for maintaining movement rapidity, reducing tendon stress and risk of injury, and possibly, for enabling muscles to operate closer to the optimum region of the length-tension relationship.
17868052	Pathways to discovery in epilepsy research: rethinking the quest for cures.	This paper, based on the 4th Annual Hoyer Lecture presented at the 2006 annual meeting of the American Epilepsy Society, first provides a general view of the current limitations in therapies aimed at achieving the goal of "no seizures, no side effects" for patients living with epilepsy. Some of the seminal discoveries in epilepsy research over the past 100 years are then reviewed, with an emphasis on the pivotal role of basic and clinical/translational science in leading the way to new and effective means for diagnosing and treating for epilepsy. The paper concludes with a view of the future course of epilepsy research. Scientific advances will increasingly rely on the collaboration of multidisciplinary teams of researchers using the analytic and storage capabilities of machines, and linked together by communication tools such as the Internet and related technologies.
17868384	Effect of growth hormone deficiency and recombinant hGH (rhGH) replacement on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in children with idiopathic isolated GH deficiency.	OBJECTIVE: Recombinant hGH (rhGH) therapy may unmask central hypoadrenalism in adults with organic GH deficiency (GHD), likely by normalizing 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 isoenzyme (11betaHSD1) activity and reducing cortisone to cortisol conversion. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in children with idiopathic isolated GHD and normal pituitary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) both before and during rhGH therapy. DESIGN AND PATIENTS: This was a single-centre study of 10 consecutive children [five males and five females, mean age: 12.2 +/- 1.0 year]. Evaluation was performed at baseline and on rhGH (mean duration: 10.9 +/- 2.9 months, mean dose: 0.030 +/- 0.002 mg/kg bw/day). MEASUREMENTS: HPA function was assessed by serum cortisol levels before and after appropriate provocative stimuli, that is, 1 microg ACTH test (N = 5 patients) or insulin tolerance test (ITT, N = 5 patients), evaluating all children with the same stimulation test both before and during rhGH therapy. Central hypoadrenalism was excluded by the presence of either a peak of > 500 nmol/l or a rise in cortisol levels of > 200 nmol/l, after both tests. RESULTS: On rhGH therapy, serum IGF-I levels normalized, while serum cortisol and ACTH levels did not significantly differ from those recorded at baseline. The mean serum cortisol peak after both provocative tests was not significantly different on rhGH therapy and at baseline (498 +/- 41 vs. 580 +/- 35 nmol/l, respectively, P = 0.06), the mean cortisol rise being 280 +/- 45 and 270 +/- 36 nmol/l on rhGH and at baseline, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: According to the diagnostic criteria, no child became hypoadrenal on rhGH, contrary to what observed in patients with organic GHD, further supporting the view that only in patients with organic multiple pituitary hormone deficiency GHD masks the presence of a hidden central hypoadrenalism.
17868415	A randomized comparison of conventional vs articulating laparoscopic needle-drivers for performing standardized suturing tasks by laparoscopy-naive subjects.	OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacy of conventional and articulating laparoscopic needle-drivers for performing standardized laparoscopic tasks by medical students with no previous surgical experience. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Twenty medical students with no surgical experience were randomly assigned to two equal groups, one using a conventional laparoscopic needle-holder (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany) and the other using a first-generation articulating laparoscopic needle-holder (Cambridge Endo, Framingham, MA, USA). Each student performed a series of four standardized laparoscopic tasks, during which speed and accuracy were assessed. The tasks tested needle passage through rings (1), an oblique running suture model (2), a urethrovesical anastomosis model (3) and a model simulating renal parenchymal reconstruction following partial nephrectomy (4). RESULTS: Tasks 1 and 3 were completed significantly more quickly by those using the conventional instruments (P < 0.05), but there was no statistically significant difference for task 2 and 4 (P > 0.05). Those using conventional instruments were significantly more accurate in all of the tasks than those using the articulated instruments (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The conventional laparoscopic needle-driver allowed laparoscopy-naive medical students to complete a series of standardized suturing tasks more rapidly and accurately than with the novel articulating needle-driver. Laparoscopic suturing with first-generation articulating needle-drivers might be more difficult to learn, secondary to the complexity of physical manoeuvres required for their use.
17869017	Increasing tumor volume is predictive of poor overall and progression-free survival: secondary analysis of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 93-11 phase I-II radiation dose-escalation study in patients with inoperable non-small-cell lung cancer.	PURPOSE: Patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 93-11 trial received radiation doses of 70.9, 77.4, 83.8, or 90.3 Gy. The locoregional control and survival rates were similar among the various dose levels. We investigated the effect of the gross tumor volume (GTV) on the outcome. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The GTV was defined as the sum of the volumes of the primary tumor and involved lymph nodes. The tumor response, median survival time (MST), and progression-free survival (PFS) were analyzed separately for smaller (< or =45 cm(3)) vs. larger (>45 cm(3)) tumors. RESULTS: The distribution of the GTV was as follows: < or =45 cm(3) in 79 (49%) and >45 cm(3) in 82 (51%) of 161 patients. The median GTV was 47.3 cm(3). N0 status and female gender were associated with better tumor responses. Patients with smaller (< or =45 cm(3)) tumors achieved a longer MST and better PFS than did patients with larger (>45 cm(3)) tumors (29.7 vs. 13.3 months, p < 0.0001; and 15.8 vs. 8.3 months, p < 0.0001, respectively). Increasing the radiation dose had no effect on the MST or PFS. On multivariate analysis, only a smaller GTV was a significant prognostic factor for improved MST and PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 2.12, p = 0.0002; and HR, 2.0, p = 0.0002, respectively). The GTV as a continuous variable was also significantly associated with the MST and PFS (HR, 1.59, p < 0.0001; and HR, 1.39, p < 0.0001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Radiation dose escalation up to 90.3 Gy did not result in improved MST or PFS. The tumor responses were greater in node-negative patients and women. An increasing GTV was strongly associated with decreased MST and PFS. Future radiotherapy trials patients might need to use stratification by tumor volume.
17869031	Experimental trial in heifers vaccinated with Staphylococcus aureus avirulent mutant against bovine mastitis.	Staphylococcus aureus, is the most frequently isolated pathogen from cases of bovine mastitis. Vaccination against S. aureus seems to be a rational approach for the control of staphylococcal mastitis. In the present work we evaluate the response of heifers vaccinated with a S. aureus avirulent mutant to the intramammary challenge with a S. aureus virulent strain. Clinical signs, production of milk, shedding of S. aureus cells, somatic cell count (SCC) and antigen-specific IgG in blood and milk, were determined. Two subcutaneous doses of a culture of the mutant, used as vaccine, was administered to four pregnant heifers 30 and 10 days before calving. The vaccinated heifers and four non-vaccinated were challenged 10 days after calving with the homologous virulent S. aureus strain, which was inoculated by intramammary route into two quarters of each animal. No local tissue damage was observed due to the administration of the vaccine. A significantly increase of specific IgG to S. aureus RC122 was detected in blood and milk of vaccinate heifers as well as a slight increase in daily milk yield during the trial. No significant difference on shedding of bacteria in milk and SCC were found among groups. In conclusion, vaccination of heifers before calving by an avirulent mutant vaccine of S. aureus, induced specific and significant antibody responses and provide better post-challenge conditions in vaccinated heifers.
17869051	The adolescent cannabis check-up: randomized trial of a brief intervention for young cannabis users.	The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a brief motivational enhancement therapy in reducing cannabis use and cannabis-related problems in a population of non-treatment-seeking adolescent cannabis users. In a randomized controlled trial, 40 young people (aged 14-19 years) were randomly assigned to either a two-session brief intervention or a 3-month delayed-treatment control condition. The intervention consisted of a detailed assessment and a session of motivational enhancement therapy. An additional optional discussion of skills for reducing or quitting cannabis use was offered if a participant was interested in discussing these issues. Primary outcome measures were changes in days of cannabis use, mean quantity of cannabis used weekly, and number of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition dependence symptoms reported. Significantly greater reductions on these measures were found in the Adolescent Cannabis Check-up group at 3-month follow-up. Between-group effect sizes were moderate. The approach is acceptable to participants and merits further evaluation with this difficult to reach population.
17869455	Detection and quantification of classical swine fever virus in air samples originating from infected pigs and experimentally produced aerosols.	During epidemics of classical swine fever (CSF), neighbourhood infections occurred where none of the 'traditional' routes of transmission like direct animal contact, swill feeding, transport contact or transmission by people could be identified. A hypothesized route of virus introduction for these herds was airborne transmission. In order to better understand this possible transmission route, we developed a method to detect and quantify classical swine fever virus (CSFV) in air samples using gelatine filters. The air samples were collected from CSFV-infected pigs after experimental aerosolization of the virus. Furthermore, we studied the viability of the virus with time in aerosolized state. Three strains of CSFV were aerosolized in an empty isolator and air samples were taken at different time intervals. The virus remained infective in aerosolized state for at least 30 min with half-life time values ranging from 4.5 to 15 min. During animal experiments, concentrations of 10(0.3)-10(1.6)TCID(50)/m(3) CSFV were detected in air samples originating from the air of the pig cages and 10(0.4)-10(4.0)TCID(50)/m(3) from the expired air of infected animals. This is the first study describing the isolation and quantification of CSFV from air samples originating from infected pigs and their cages, supporting previous findings that airborne transmission of CSF is feasible.
17869528	Antennal sensilla of the decapitating phorid fly, Pseudacteon tricuspis (Diptera: Phoridae).	Pseudacteon tricuspis Borgmeier is a parasitic decapitating phorid fly (Diptera: Phoridae), which has been released in the southern United States in the last decade for biological control of invasive imported fire ants, Solenopsis spp. In a previous study, we demonstrated that P. tricuspis uses fire ant semiochemicals to locate host worker ants. To provide a solid background in support of our research on mechanisms of host location and olfaction in phorid flies, we studied the morphology of the antennal sensilla of both sexes of P. tricuspis using scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Antennae of P. tricuspis show strong sexual dimorphism in structure and shape: the female has a feathered arista which is located distally on the flagellum and has three sub-segments that bear small spinules of microtrichia. The first two antennal segments, scape and pedicel, bear no sensillum, but were densely covered by microtrichia. Three major types of sensilla were found on the flagellum (funicle) of both sexes: sensilla trichodea, sensilla basiconica, and sensilla coeloconica. Two of these, s. trichodea and s. basiconica were differentiated into three (short, medium, and long) and two (blunt-tip and sharp-tip) subtypes, respectively, for a total of six morphologically different sensilla subtypes. Ultrastructural studies revealed multiple wall pores on s. trichodea and s. basiconica, possibly suggesting chemoreceptory functions. The third and least abundant sensilla type, s. coeloconica, had no wall pores and may function as thermo-hygroreceptors. With the exception of the long subtype of s. trichodea which was recorded only on the male antennae, no other marked sexual differences were recorded in the number and distribution of antennal sensilla in P. tricuspis. These results are discussed in relation to the host location behavior of P. tricuspis, and could facilitate future studies on the neurobiology of olfaction in decapitating phorid flies.
17870661	Aircraft noise: effects on macro- and microstructure of sleep.	OBJECTIVE: The effects of aircraft noise on sleep macrostructure (Rechtschaffen and Kales) and microstructure (American Sleep Disorders Association [ASDA] arousal criteria) were investigated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: For each of 10 subjects (mean age 35.3 years, 5 males), a baseline night without aircraft noise (control), and two nights with exposure to 64 noise events with a maximum sound pressure level (SPL) of either 45 or 65 dBA were chosen. Spontaneous and noise-induced alterations during sleep classified as arousals (ARS), changes to lighter sleep stages (CSS), awakenings including changes to sleep stage 1 (AS1), and awakenings (AWR) were analyzed. RESULTS: The number of events per night increased in the order AWR, AS1, CSS, and ARS under control conditions as well as under the two noise conditions. Furthermore, probabilities for sleep disruptions increased with increasing noise level. ARS were observed about fourfold compared to AWR, irrespective of control or noise condition. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions investigated, different sleep parameters show different sensitivities, but also different specificities for noise-induced sleep disturbances. We conclude that most information on sleep disturbances can be achieved by investigating robust classic parameters like AWR or AS1, although ASDA electroencephalographic (EEG) arousals might add relevant information in situations with low maximum SPLs, chronic sleep deprivation or chronic exposure.
17872897	Characterization of nanomaterial dispersion in solution prior to in vitro exposure using dynamic light scattering technique.	The need to characterize nanoparticles in solution before assessing the in vitro toxicity is a high priority. Particle size, size distribution, particle morphology, particle composition, surface area, surface chemistry, and particle reactivity in solution are important factors which need to be defined to accurately assess nanoparticle toxicity. Currently, there are no well-defined techniques for characterization of wet nanomaterials in aqueous or biological solutions. Previously reported nanoparticle characterization techniques in aqueous or biological solutions have consisted of the use of ultra-high illumination light microscopy and disc centrifuge sedimentation; however, these techniques are limited by the measurement size range. The current study focuses on characterizing a wide range of nanomaterials using dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy, including metals, metal oxides, and carbon-based materials, in water and cell culture media, with and without serum. Cell viability and cell morphology studies were conducted in conjunction with DLS experiments to evaluate toxicological effects from observed agglomeration changes in the presence or absence of serum in cell culture media. Observations of material-specific surface properties were also recorded. It was also necessary to characterize the impact of sonication, which is implemented to aid in particle dispersion and solution mixture. Additionally, a stock solution of nanomaterials used for toxicology studies was analyzed for changes in agglomeration and zeta potential of the material over time. In summary, our results demonstrate that many metal and metal oxide nanomaterials agglomerate in solution and that depending upon the solution particle agglomeration is either agitated or mitigated. Corresponding toxicity data revealed that the addition of serum to cell culture media can, in some cases, have a significant effect on particle toxicity possibly due to changes in agglomeration or surface chemistry. It was also observed that sonication slightly reduces agglomeration and has minimal effect on particle surface charge. Finally, the stock solution experienced significant changes in particle agglomeration and surface charge over time.
17872953	Micro- and macrorheological properties of isotropically cross-linked actin networks.	Cells make use of semiflexible biopolymers such as actin or intermediate filaments to control their local viscoelastic response by dynamically adjusting the concentration and type of cross-linking molecules. The microstructure of the resulting networks mainly determines their mechanical properties. It remains an important challenge to relate structural transitions to both the molecular properties of the cross-linking molecules and the mechanical response of the network. This can be achieved best by well defined in vitro model systems in combination with microscopic techniques. Here, we show that with increasing concentrations of the cross-linker heavy meromyosin, a transition in the mechanical network response occurs. At low cross-linker densities the network elasticity is dominated by the entanglement length l(e) of the polymer, whereas at high heavy meromyosin densities the cross-linker distance l(c) determines the elastic behavior. Using microrheology the formation of heterogeneous networks is observed at low cross-linker concentrations. Micro- and macrorheology both report the same transition to a homogeneous cross-linked phase. This transition is set by a constant average cross-linker distance l(c) approximately 15 microm. Thus, the micro- and macromechanical properties of isotropically cross-linked in vitro actin networks are determined by only one intrinsic network parameter.
17873057	Work and peak torque during eccentric exercise do not predict changes in markers of muscle damage.	OBJECTIVES: Large inter-subject variability in responses to eccentric exercise has been reported. This study investigated the hypothesis that the variability of changes in indirect markers of exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD) would be explained by work performed and/or torque generated during eccentric exercise. METHODS: Subjects (n = 53) performed 60 maximal eccentric actions of the elbow flexors on an isokinetic dynamometer that forcibly extended the elbow joint from 60 degrees to 180 degrees at a constant velocity (90 degrees s(-1)). Markers of EIMD included maximal voluntary isometric contraction torque at 90 degrees elbow flexion (MVC), range of motion, plasma creatine kinase activity and muscle soreness. Measurements were taken 2 days before, immediately after and 1-4 days post-exercise. Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to examine relationships between exercise parameters (total work, change in total work, torque produced during exercise, change in peak torque) and markers of EIMD. RESULTS: Large inter-subject variability was evident for both work and torque during exercise, and changes in all markers of EIMD. Contrary to the hypothesis, total work (normalised for individual pre-exercise MVC) did not correlate significantly with any markers of EIMD, with the exception of MVC (r = 0.3). Total work performed and changes in total work showed higher correlations with some markers, but no r-values exceeded 0.4. Normalised exercise torque and the changes in peak torque during exercise were not correlated with changes in MVC, or other markers. CONCLUSION: These results suggest the large inter-subject variability in responses to eccentric exercise is not associated with work performed or torque generated during eccentric exercise.
17873121	Identification of novel candidate genes associated with cleft lip and palate using array comparative genomic hybridisation.	AIM AND METHOD: We analysed DNA samples isolated from individuals born with cleft lip and cleft palate to identify deletions and duplications of candidate gene loci using array comparative genomic hybridisation (array-CGH). RESULTS: Of 83 syndromic cases analysed we identified one subject with a previously unknown 2.7 Mb deletion at 22q11.21 coinciding with the DiGeorge syndrome region. Eighteen of the syndromic cases had clinical features of Van der Woude syndrome and deletions were identified in five of these, all of which encompassed the interferon regulatory factor 6 (IRF6) gene. In a series of 104 non-syndromic cases we found one subject with a 3.2 Mb deletion at chromosome 6q25.1-25.2 and another with a 2.2 Mb deletion at 10q26.11-26.13. Analyses of parental DNA demonstrated that the two deletion cases at 22q11.21 and 6q25.1-25.2 were de novo, while the deletion of 10q26.11-26.13 was inherited from the mother, who also has a cleft lip. These deletions appear likely to be causally associated with the phenotypes of the subjects. Estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) and fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) genes from the 6q25.1-25.2 and 10q26.11-26.13, respectively, were identified as likely causative genes using a gene prioritization software. CONCLUSION: We have shown that array-CGH analysis of DNA samples derived from cleft lip and palate subjects is an efficient and productive method for identifying candidate chromosomal loci and genes, complementing traditional genetic mapping strategies.
17874249	Distraction osteogenesis of the femur using conventional monolateral external fixator.	INTRODUCTION: The author has developed a new simple technique of distraction osteogenesis using conventional monolateral external fixator for femoral lengthening. The primary purpose of the present study was to evaluate the results of treatment with this new technique of femoral lengthening and also to evaluate the effect of preoperative and intraoperative variables on the outcome of distraction osteogenesis in general. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-one femora in 50 patients were lengthened. Limb-length discrepancy was the primary indication in all patients. The mean age of the patients at the time of the surgery was 21.9 years (range 5-48 years). The average follow-up period was 24.6 months after removal of the fixator (range 6-120 months). All lengthenings were performed using conventional AO/ASIF external fixator. Twenty-two femora had associated axial or rotational deformities. Gradual distraction was performed to increase length and to correct angular deformity in coronal plane. Acute closed wedge angular correction in sagittal plane or derotation was performed in 12 femora in this study. RESULTS: The length of the 51 femora was increased by an average 4.4 cm (range 1-13 cm), or 12% (range 2.5-40.9%). The average healing index was 50.5 days/cm (range 22.5-110.6 days/cm). Average gradual angular correction in coronal plane in 14 femora was 20.4 degrees (range 10-45 degrees ). Average acute correction in sagittal plane in five femora was 17 degrees (range 10-20 degrees ). Average acute derotation in six femora was 24.2 degrees (range 10-60 degrees ). There were a total of 61 complications, including 26 problems, 18 obstacles, and 17 sequelae. The overall rate of complications was 1.2 per femur. Fifteen femora had delayed consolidation (healing index >54 days/cm). Three of 51 lengthening procedures did not lead to consolidation (nonunion). A significant negative parabolic relationship was noted between the healing index and the amount of length gained (R = -0.47 and P = 0.004). There was a significantly positive exponential relationship between age and healing index (R = 0.51 and P < 0.001). Acute deformity correction, level of osteotomy (submetaphysis versus diaphysis) had no significant effect on healing index. The greater amount of length gained was associated with complications. CONCLUSIONS: The newly presented technique of distraction osteogenesis is a useful and cost-effective method for femoral lengthening. Increased lengthenings produced a better healing index but might associate with complications. Younger age was associated with better bone healing but age had no effect on complication rate. Level of osteotomy, acute deformity correction had no effect on healing index and rate of complications.
17875318	The AF4-mimetic peptide, PFWT, induces necrotic cell death in MV4-11 leukemia cells.	Despite ongoing success in the treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia, patients harboring translocations involving the MLL gene at chromosome 11q23 remain resistant to treatment. To improve outcomes, novel therapeutics designed to target the unusual biology of these leukemias need to be developed. Previously, we identified an interaction between the two most common MLL fusion proteins, AF4 and AF9, and designed a synthetic peptide (PFWT) capable of disrupting this interaction. PFWT induced cell death in leukemia cells expressing MLL-AF4 with little effect on the colony forming potential of hematopoietic progenitor cells, suggesting the AF4-AF9 complex is an important pharmacological target for leukemia therapy and PFWT is a promising chemotherapeutic prototype. In these studies, we demonstrate that PFWT induces death by necrosis in MV4-11 cells. Cell death is characterized by rapid loss of plasma membrane integrity with maintenance of nuclear membrane integrity, and is independent of caspase activation, DNA fragmentation, and mitochondrial membrane depolarization. PFWT-mediated necrosis is inhibited by the serine protease inhibitor TLCK, suggesting this death pathway is regulated. Given the resistance of t(4;11) leukemias to conventional chemotherapeutic agents that induce apoptosis, further identification of the molecular events mediating this death process should uncover new avenues for therapeutic intervention.
17876342	PXR, CAR and HNF4alpha genotypes and their association with pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of docetaxel and doxorubicin in Asian patients.	Previously studied candidate genes have failed to account for inter-individual variability of docetaxel and doxorubicin disposition and effects. We genotyped the transcriptional regulators of CYP3A and ABCB1 in 101 breast cancer patients from 3 Asian ethnic groups, that is, Chinese, Malays and Indians, in correlation with the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of docetaxel and doxorubicin. While there was no ethnic difference in docetaxel and doxorubicin pharmacokinetics, ethnic difference in docetaxel- (ANOVA, P=0.001) and doxorubicin-induced (ANOVA, P=0.003) leukocyte suppression was observed, with Chinese and Indians experiencing greater degree of docetaxel-induced myelosuppression than Malays (Bonferroni, P=0.002, P=0.042), and Chinese experiencing greater degree of doxorubicin-induced myelosuppression than Malays and Indians (post hoc Bonferroni, P=0.024 and 0.025). Genotyping revealed both PXR and CAR to be well conserved; only a PXR 5'-untranslated region polymorphism (-24381A>C) and a silent CAR variant (Pro180Pro) were found at allele frequencies of 26 and 53%, respectively. Two non-synonymous variants were identified in HNF4alpha (Met49Val and Thr130Ile) at allele frequencies of 55 and 1%, respectively, with the Met49Val variant associated with slower neutrophil recovery in docetaxel-treated patients (ANOVA, P=0.046). Interactions were observed between HNF4alpha Met49Val and CAR Pro180Pro, with patients who were wild type for both variants experiencing least docetaxel-induced neutropenia (ANOVA, P=0.030). No other significant genotypic associations with pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of either drug were found. The PXR-24381A>C variants were significantly more common in Indians compared to Chinese or Malays (32/18/21%, P=0.035) Inter-individual and inter-ethnic variations of docetaxel and doxorubicin pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics exist, but genotypic variability of the transcriptional regulators PAR, CAR and HNF4alpha cannot account for this variability.
17876491	Pelvic floor muscle training improves sexual function of women with stress urinary incontinence.	The aim of this study was to assess the effect of a program of supervised pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) on sexual function, in a group of women with urodynamically diagnosed stress urinary incontinence (SUI), using a validated questionnaire. Incontinence episodes frequency and continence pads used per week were measured before and after treatment using a 7-day bladder diary. Improvements in sexual function were assessed using the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI). Seventy women completed the 12-month program of supervised PFMT successfully. At the end of the study, incontinence episode frequency decreased by 38.1%, and patients required 39% less pads per week. All domains of the FSFI were also significantly improved with median total FSFI scores increasing from 20.3 to 26.8. This is one of the few studies to quantify, using a validated questionnaire, the improvement in sexual function of women with SUI, undergoing successfully a 12-month supervised PFMT program.
17876760	Prediction of protein loop conformations using multiscale modeling methods with physical energy scoring functions.	This article examines ab initio methods for the prediction of protein loops by a computational strategy of multiscale conformational sampling and physical energy scoring functions. Our approach consists of initial sampling of loop conformations from lattice-based low-resolution models followed by refinement using all-atom simulations. To allow enhanced conformational sampling, the replica exchange method was implemented. Physical energy functions based on CHARMM19 and CHARMM22 parameterizations with generalized Born (GB) solvent models were applied in scoring loop conformations extracted from the lattice simulations and, in the case of all-atom simulations, the ensemble of conformations were generated and scored with these models. Predictions are reported for 25 loop segments, each eight residues long and taken from a diverse set of 22 protein structures. We find that the simulations generally sampled conformations with low global root-mean-square-deviation (RMSD) for loop backbone coordinates from the known structures, whereas clustering conformations in RMSD space and scoring detected less favorable loop structures. Specifically, the lattice simulations sampled basins that exhibited an average global RMSD of 2.21 +/- 1.42 A, whereas clustering and scoring the loop conformations determined an RMSD of 3.72 +/- 1.91 A. Using CHARMM19/GB to refine the lattice conformations improved the sampling RMSD to 1.57 +/- 0.98 A and detection to 2.58 +/- 1.48 A. We found that further improvement could be gained from extending the upper temperature in the all-atom refinement from 400 to 800 K, where the results typically yield a reduction of approximately 1 A or greater in the RMSD of the detected loop. Overall, CHARMM19 with a simple pairwise GB solvent model is more efficient at sampling low-RMSD loop basins than CHARMM22 with a higher-resolution modified analytical GB model; however, the latter simulation method provides a more accurate description of the all-atom energy surface, yet demands a much greater computational cost.
17876813	Exploring the extremes of sequence/structure space with ensemble fold recognition in the program Phyre.	Structural and functional annotation of the large and growing database of genomic sequences is a major problem in modern biology. Protein structure prediction by detecting remote homology to known structures is a well-established and successful annotation technique. However, the broad spectrum of evolutionary change that accompanies the divergence of close homologues to become remote homologues cannot easily be captured with a single algorithm. Recent advances to tackle this problem have involved the use of multiple predictive algorithms available on the Internet. Here we demonstrate how such ensembles of predictors can be designed in-house under controlled conditions and permit significant improvements in recognition by using a concept taken from protein loop energetics and applying it to the general problem of 3D clustering. We have developed a stringent test that simulates the situation where a protein sequence of interest is submitted to multiple different algorithms and not one of these algorithms can make a confident (95%) correct assignment. A method of meta-server prediction (Phyre) that exploits the benefits of a controlled environment for the component methods was implemented. At 95% precision or higher, Phyre identified 64.0% of all correct homologous query-template relationships, and 84.0% of the individual test query proteins could be accurately annotated. In comparison to the improvement that the single best fold recognition algorithm (according to training) has over PSI-Blast, this represents a 29.6% increase in the number of correct homologous query-template relationships, and a 46.2% increase in the number of accurately annotated queries. It has been well recognised in fold prediction, other bioinformatics applications, and in many other areas, that ensemble predictions generally are superior in accuracy to any of the component individual methods. However there is a paucity of information as to why the ensemble methods are superior and indeed this has never been systematically addressed in fold recognition. Here we show that the source of ensemble power stems from noise reduction in filtering out false positive matches. The results indicate greater coverage of sequence space and improved model quality, which can consequently lead to a reduction in the experimental workload of structural genomics initiatives.
17876818	Position-resolved free energy of solvation for amino acids in lipid membranes from molecular dynamics simulations.	Studies of insertion and interactions of amino acids in lipid membranes are pivotal to our understanding of membrane protein structure and function. Calculating the insertion cost as a function of transmembrane helix sequence is thus an important step towards improved membrane protein prediction and eventually drug design. Here, we present position-dependent free energies of solvation for all amino acid analogs along the membrane normal. The profiles cover the entire region from bulk water to hydrophobic core, and were produced from all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. Experimental differences corresponding to mutations and costs for entire segments match experimental data well, and in addition the profiles provide the spatial resolution currently not available from experiments. Polar side-chains largely maintain their hydration and assume quite ordered conformations, which indicates the solvation cost is mainly entropic. The cost of solvating charged side-chains is not only significantly lower than for implicit solvation models, but also close to experiments, meaning these could well maintain their protonation states inside the membrane. The single notable exception to the experimental agreement is proline, which is quite expensive to introduce in vivo despite its hydrophobicity--a difference possibly explained by kinks making it harder to insert helices in the translocon.
17877452	Flash signal evolution, mate choice, and predation in fireflies.	Many key advances in our understanding of firefly biology and signaling have been made over the past two decades. Here we review this recent research, which includes new phylogenetic results that shed light on the evolution of courtship signal diversity within the family Lampyridae, new insights into firefly flash control, and the discovery of firefly nuptial gifts. We present a comprehensive overview of sexual selection in lampyrids, including evidence from Photinus fireflies that females choose their mates on the basis of male flash signals, and discuss the importance of examining both precopulatory and postcopulatory sexual selection in this group. Finally, we review recent findings on firefly chemical defenses, and discuss their implications for flash signal evolution in response to generalist predators as well as specialist predatory fireflies. This review provides new insight into how firefly flash signals have been shaped by the dual evolutionary processes of sexual selection (mate choice) and natural selection (predation), and proposes several exciting directions for future research.
17877457	Prevention of tick-borne diseases.	Tick-borne diseases are on the rise. Lyme borreliosis is prevalent throughout the Northern Hemisphere, and the same Ixodes tick species transmitting the etiologic agents of this disease also serve as vectors of pathogens causing human babesiosis, human granulocytic anaplasmosis, and tick-borne encephalitis. Recently, several novel agents of rickettsial diseases have been described. Despite an explosion of knowledge in the fields of tick biology, genetics, molecular biology, and immunology, transitional research leading to widely applied public health measures to combat tick-borne diseases has not been successful. Except for the vaccine against tick-borne encephalitis virus, and a brief campaign to reduce this disease in the former Soviet Union through widespread application of DDT, success stories in the fight against tick-borne diseases are lacking. Both new approaches to tick and pathogen control and novel ways of translating research findings into practical control measures are needed to prevent tick-borne diseases in the twenty-first century.
17877727	Development and public release of a comprehensive hepatitis virus database.	AIM: Currently, approximately 44 000 hepatitis C virus (HCV), 11 000 hepatitis B virus (HBV), and 1600 hepatitis E virus (HEV) sequences are available at the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC, previously known as DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank), and the number of these virus sequences is growing rapidly. However, since INDSC is not specialized to hepatitis viruses, it is difficult to retrieve information of virological or clinical interests from it. Thus, it is quite worthwhile to construct a specialized database for the hepatitis virus sequences and to make it accessible to researchers worldwide. METHODS: We developed a WWW-based database hepatitis virus database (HVDB), which contains all the HCV, HBV, and HEV sequences available at INSDC. In the HVDB, all piece sequences obtained from INSDC are arranged to the genomesequence of each virus. Also given in the database are the phylogenetic relationships of each locus on the genome among variants for each virus. RESULTS: Users of the database can easily retrieve entries (sequences with annotations) of the specific genotype by referring to the phylogenetic relationships or those of specific loci by referring to the genome map information. HVDB provides users with a tool for phylogenetic analysis that can be used in combination with the data retrieval tools. CONCLUSION: The latest release is publicly accessible at the HVDB website: http://s2as02.genes.nig.ac.jp.
17878269	Study of early leaf senescence in Arabidopsis thaliana by quantitative proteomics using reciprocal 14N/15N labeling and difference gel electrophoresis.	Leaf senescence represents the final stage of leaf development and is associated with fundamental changes on the level of the proteome. For the quantitative analysis of changes in protein abundance related to early leaf senescence, we designed an elaborate double and reverse labeling strategy simultaneously employing fluorescent two-dimensional DIGE as well as metabolic (15)N labeling followed by MS. Reciprocal (14)N/(15)N labeling of entire Arabidopsis thaliana plants showed that full incorporation of (15)N into the proteins of the plant did not cause any adverse effects on development and protein expression. A direct comparison of DIGE and (15)N labeling combined with MS showed that results obtained by both quantification methods correlated well for proteins showing low to moderate regulation factors. Nano HPLC/ESI-MS/MS analysis of 21 protein spots that consistently exhibited abundance differences in nine biological replicates based on both DIGE and MS resulted in the identification of 13 distinct proteins and protein subunits that showed significant regulation in Arabidopsis mutant plants displaying advanced leaf senescence. Ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase large and three of its four small subunits were found to be down-regulated, which reflects the degradation of the photosynthetic machinery during leaf senescence. Among the proteins showing higher abundance in mutant plants were several members of the glutathione S-transferase family class phi and quinone reductase. Up-regulation of these proteins fits well into the context of leaf senescence since they are generally involved in the protection of plant cells against reactive oxygen species which are increasingly generated by lipid degradation during leaf senescence. With the exception of one glutathione S-transferase isoform, none of these proteins has been linked to leaf senescence before.
17878274	Sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 expression and genetic polymorphism significantly affect intramuscular fat deposition in the longissimus muscle of Erhualian and Sutai pigs.	Two experiments were performed to elucidate the role of sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 (SREBF1) in i.m. fat (IMF) deposition in pigs. In Exp. 1, LM samples were removed from 4 male and 4 female Erhualian piglets at 3, 20, and 45 d of age, and SREBF1 mRNA expression level and IMF content were measured. Intramuscular fat content and expression of SREBF1 mRNA was greater (P < 0.05) in females than males at all 3 stages of age, providing initial evidence that the level of SREBF1 mRNA expression is related to IMF deposition in muscle of suckling pigs. Additionally, in Exp. 2 there was a positive correlation between the SREBF1 mRNA level and IMF content (r = 0.67, P < 0.01) in 100 Sutai finishing pigs, a synthetic line produced by crossing Erhualian and Duroc pigs. Single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of the reverse transcription PCR products of the SREBF1 gene revealed 3 genotypes in Sutai pigs with frequencies of 50% for AA, 36% for AB, and 14% for BB, respectively. Both SREBF1 mRNA level and IMF content in muscle were greater (P < 0.05) in AB and BB animals than in AA animals, whereas no difference in backfat thickness was observed among the 3 genotypes. Sequencing analysis identified 2 SNP at T1006C and C1033T within the open reading frame of the SREBF1 gene (NM_214157). Although both are silent mutations, they affected the secondary structure of SREBF1 mRNA. These results suggest that SREBF1 might play an important role in regulation of muscle fat deposition during postnatal growth of pigs. The SNP identified in the SREBF1 gene suggest that it could be used as a genetic marker to improve IMF content in pigs.
17878891	Adipocytokines and proinflammatory mediators from abdominal and epicardial adipose tissue in patients with coronary artery disease.	OBJECTIVE: Epicardial and abdominal adipose tissues have recently been demonstrated to play inflammatory roles in coronary atherosclerosis. We sought to compare tissue adipocytokine levels of these two anatomically distinct adipose stores in patients with and without coronary artery diseases (CAD). DESIGN: Samples of abdominal and epicardial fat tissues were harvested to detect the levels of adipocytokines and proinflammatory mediators. SUBJECTS: Forty-six patients with CAD who underwent coronary artery bypass surgery and 12 non-CAD control subjects who underwent other types of open-heart surgery. MEASUREMENTS: Tissue levels of adipocytokines (adiponectin, leptin and visfatin) and proinflammatory mediators (tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6)) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Tissue levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6, leptin and visfatin were significantly higher in CAD patients relative to control subjects. In addition, significantly higher tissue levels of these four cytokines from abdominal fat depots were found compared to those from epicardial fat in CAD patients. Conversely, in comparison with control subjects, tissue levels of adiponectin were significantly reduced in CAD patients with a significantly lower tissue levels of abdominal than epicardial fat depots demonstrated. CONCLUSION: Abdominal adiposity may play more significant role than epicardial fat in the pathogenesis of coronary atherosclerosis.
17881140	Skin-sparing radiation using intensity-modulated radiotherapy after conservative surgery in early-stage breast cancer: a planning study.	PURPOSE: To evaluate the feasibility of skin-sparing by configuring it as an organ-at-risk (OAR) while delivering whole-breast intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in early breast cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Archival computed tomography scan images of 14 left-sided early-breast tumor patients who had undergone lumpectomy were selected for this study. Skin was contoured as a 4- to 5-mm strip extending from the patient outline to anterior margin of the breast planning target volume (PTV). Two IMRT plans were generated by the helical tomotherapy approach to deliver 50 Gy in 25 fractions to the breast alone: one with skin dose constraints (skin-sparing plan) and the other without (non-skin-sparing plan). Comparison of the plans was done using a two-sided paired Student t test. RESULTS: The mean skin dose and volume of skin receiving 50 Gy were significantly less with the skin-sparing plan compared with non-skin-sparing plan (42.3 Gy vs. 47.7 Gy and 12.2% vs. 57.8% respectively; p < 0.001). The reduction in skin dose was confirmed by TLD measurements in anthropomorphic phantom using the same plans. Dose-volume analyses for other OARs were similar in both plans. CONCLUSIONS: By configuring the skin as an OAR, it is possible to achieve skin dose reduction while delivering whole-breast IMRT without compromising dose profiles to PTV and OARs.
17881152	Plant folk medicines for gastrointestinal disorders among the main tribes of Sonora, Mexico.	This paper describes the herbal remedies used by ethnic groups from Sonora, Mexico, for treatment of gastrointestinal diseases. Twelve types of these illnesses are cured using 85 different species which belong to 38 families. Thirty nine spp. are used to treat diarrhea, 28 for stomach-ache, 12 for constipation, 9 for intestinal parasites, 6 for indigestion, 3 for stomach or intestinal cancer, 3 for stomach inflammation and only 1 to treat gastrointestinal sicknesses, ulcers, gastritis, colitis and colic. Regarding the use of species of plant per ethnic group the following was observed: Mayo 47; Seri, 27; Yaqui, 13; Guarijio, 12, Pima, 5 and Papago, 3. The plants are used by two or more tribes, for the same or different illness but always related to the gastrointestinal system.
17881301	Insights from site-specific phosphoproteomics in bacteria.	Recent advances in mass spectrometry allowed the charting of bacterial serine/threonine/tyrosine phosphoproteomes with unprecedented accuracy, including the acquisition of a large number of phosphorylation sites. Phosphorylated bacterial proteins are involved in some key housekeeping processes, and their phosphorylation is expected to play an important regulatory role. When coupled to stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC), high-resolution mass spectrometry allows the detection of changes in the occupancy of phosphorylation sites in response to various stimuli. This and similar approaches promise to lead bacterial phosphoproteomics into the era of systems biology, where the entire phosphorylation-based regulatory networks will be charted, modelled, and ultimately engineered to obtain desired properties.
17881371	SmedGD: the Schmidtea mediterranea genome database.	The planarian Schmidtea mediterranea is rapidly emerging as a model organism for the study of regeneration, tissue homeostasis and stem cell biology. The recent sequencing, assembly and annotation of its genome are expected to further buoy the biomedical importance of this organism. In order to make the extensive data associated with the genome sequence accessible to the biomedical and planarian communities, we have created the Schmidtea mediterranea Genome Database (SmedGD). SmedGD integrates in a single web-accessible portal all available data associated with the planarian genome, including predicted and annotated genes, ESTs, protein homologies, gene expression patterns and RNAi phenotypes. Moreover, SmedGD was designed using tools provided by the Generic Model Organism Database (GMOD) project, thus making its data structure compatible with other model organism databases. Because of the unique phylogenetic position of planarians, SmedGD (http://smedgd.neuro.utah.edu) will prove useful not only to the planarian research community, but also to those engaged in developmental and evolutionary biology, comparative genomics, stem cell research and regeneration.
17884002	Mucosal leishmaniasis . Current scenario and prospects for treatment.	Leishmaniasis causes significant morbidity and mortality and thus constitutes a serious public health problem. Even though it has long been endemic in developing countries, in recent years the economic globalization and the increased volume of international travel have extended its prevalence in developed countries. In addition, native populations may be exposed to the infection through blood transfusion and the use of blood products produced from infected asymptomatic individuals. Mucosal leishmaniasis (ML) is a chronic form of this infection, which attacks the mucosa. In most cases this form of leishmaniasis results from the metastatic spread of Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis from cutaneous lesions. It is a healthcare issue because of its wide demographic distribution, its association with significant morbidity levels, and because of the pressing concern that tourists who travel to endemic areas might present the disease even years later. The treatment currently available for ML is based on drugs such as pentavalent antimony-containing compounds, amphotericin B deoxycholate and pentamidine and often guarantees a satisfactory clinical response. Nevertheless, it also frequently provokes serious side effects. This review offers a critical analysis of the drugs now available for the treatment of ML as also of the future prospects for the treatment of the disease.
17884311	The influence of fluorides on mouse sperm capacitation.	Increasing infertility, due to pathological changes on sperm, has become a serious issue. Eco-toxicological effect of rising concentration of fluorides can be enhanced in the presence of aluminium ions by forming fluorometallic complexes, analogues of phosphate groups that interfere with the activity of G-proteins and P-type ATPases, which are part of several signalling pathways during sperm maturation. In order for sperm to gain fertilizing ability, they must undergo in the female reproductive tract, capacitation that includes tyrosine phosphorylation and consequent actin polymerization. The present paper reports the findings of 3-month oral toxicity in mice of fluorides at the concentrations 0, 1, 10, and 100ppm and their synergic action with aluminium at dose of 10ppm. There were no mortalities, clinical signs of discomfort or body weight loss during the experiment. The analysis revealed, for the concentrations of 10 and 100ppm, abnormalities of spermatogenesis and ability of epididymal spermatozoa to capacitate in vitro, as the result of decreased sperm head tyrosine phosphorylation and actin polymerization. The enhancing overload caused by fluorides represents a potential factor, having an impact on function of sperm, hence contributing to a growing infertility in the human population.
17886233	Mendelian randomization: using genes as instruments for making causal inferences in epidemiology.	Observational epidemiological studies suffer from many potential biases, from confounding and from reverse causation, and this limits their ability to robustly identify causal associations. Several high-profile situations exist in which randomized controlled trials of precisely the same intervention that has been examined in observational studies have produced markedly different findings. In other observational sciences, the use of instrumental variable (IV) approaches has been one approach to strengthening causal inferences in non-experimental situations. The use of germline genetic variants that proxy for environmentally modifiable exposures as instruments for these exposures is one form of IV analysis that can be implemented within observational epidemiological studies. The method has been referred to as 'Mendelian randomization', and can be considered as analogous to randomized controlled trials. This paper outlines Mendelian randomization, draws parallels with IV methods, provides examples of implementation of the approach and discusses limitations of the approach and some methods for dealing with these.
17886272	Global gene expression analysis of bovine blastocysts produced by multiple methods.	Reproductive efficiency using somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) technology remains suboptimal. Of the various efforts to improve the efficiency, chromatin transfer (CT) and clone-clone aggregation (NTagg) have been reported to produce live cloned animals. To better understand the molecular mechanisms of somatic cell reprogramming during SCNT and assess the various SCNT methods on the molecular level, we performed gene expression analysis on bovine blastocysts produced via standard nuclear transfer (NT), CT, NTagg, in vitro fertilization (IVF), and artificial insemination (AI), as well as on somatic donor cells, using bovine genome arrays. The expression profiles of SCNT (NT, CT, NTagg) embryos were compared with IVF and AI embryos as well as donor cells. NT and CT embryos have indistinguishable gene expression patterns. In comparison to IVF or AI embryos, the number of differentially expressed genes in NTagg embryos is significantly higher than in NT and CT embryos. Genes that were differentially expressed between all the SCNT embryos and IVF or AI embryos are identified. Compared to AI embryos, more than half of the genes found deregulated between SCNT and AI embryos appear to be the result of in vitro culture alone. The results indicate that although SCNT methods have altered differentiated somatic nuclei gene expression to more closely resemble that of embryonic nuclei, combination of insufficient reprogramming and in vitro culture condition compromise the developmental potential of SCNT embryos. This is the first set of comprehensive data for analyzing the molecular impact of various nuclear transfer methods on bovine pre-implantation embryos.
17888201	Exploring the relationship between sugars and obesity.	OBJECTIVE: Investigate the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and intake of sugars and fat in New Zealand adults and children. DESIGN: Secondary analyses of National Nutrition Survey (1997) and Children's Nutrition Survey (2002) data for the New Zealand population. BMI calculated from height and weight; fat, sugars and sucrose (used as a surrogate for added sugars) intakes estimated from 24-hour diet recall. Ethnic-specific analyses of children's data. Relationships (using linear regression) between BMI and sugars/sucrose intakes; per cent total energy from fat; mean total energy intake from sucrose. Subjects classified into diet-type groups by levels of intake of fat and sucrose; relative proportions of overweight/obese children in each group compared with that of normal weight subjects using design-adjusted chi2 tests. SETTING: New Zealand homes and schools. SUBJECTS: 4379 adults (15+ years); 3049 children (5-14 years). RESULTS: Sugars (but not sucrose) intake was significantly lower among obese compared to normal weight children. In adults and children, those with the lowest intake of sugars from foods were significantly more likely to be overweight/obese. Sucrose came predominantly from beverages; in children, 45% of this was from powdered drinks. Sucrose intake from sugary beverages was not related to BMI. Per cent total energy (%E) from sucrose was significantly inversely related to %E from fat among adults and children. Proportions of overweight/obese adults or children in each diet-type group did not differ from that of normal weight individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Current sugars or sucrose intake is not associated with body weight status in the New Zealand population.
17888526	Urocortin II increases spontaneous parental behavior in prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster).	Stress and anxiety play a role in many psychological processes including social behavior. The present study examines the effects of urocortin II (UCN II) on spontaneous parental behavior in adult prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster). UCN II was found to increase passive parental behavior in voles while not affecting any stress-related measures. Delineating the mechanism of this change will aid in our understanding of the regulation of parenting.
17888554	Behavioral effects of 6-bromoflavanone and 5-methoxy-6,8-dibromoflavanone as anxiolytic compounds.	Benzodiazepines (BDZs) are the most used psychoactive drugs in the pharmacotherapy of anxiety. A large number of structurally different classes of ligands are also active in the modulation of anxiety, showing high affinity for the benzodiazepine binding site (BDZ-bs) of the GABA (A) receptor complex. Various synthetic derivatives of natural flavonoids have been found to have very potent anxiolytic properties. This study was undertaken to provide a behavioral characterization of two novels halogenated flavonoids, 5-methoxy-6, 8-dibromoflavanone (FV1), and 6-bromoflavanone (FV2). These compounds were tested and compared to diazepam (0.5 mg/kg) and to the natural flavonoid chrysin (1 mg/kg) as a standard of activity. When injected in mice (0.5, 1 mg/kg i.p) both synthetic flavonoids increased the locomotor activity and the exploratory skills of the animals, as measured in the open-field and in the hole-board tests. Both compounds, indeed, had a clear anxiolytic activity in the elevated plus-maze, as measured by an increased number of entries and the percentage of time spent in the open arms. At the tested doses, both compounds did not induce sedative action or compulsive behaviour. These results encourage making deeper investigations on this field.
17888563	Chinese villages and their sustainable future: the European Union-China-Research Project "SUCCESS".	China has 800,000 villages-one person out of seven on the globe is living in a Chinese rural settlement. Yet the global discussions about the situation in China is currently characterised by a disproportionate focus on the development of towns and until now circumstances have generally been neglected in the rural areas, where 70% of the Chinese population is still living. Within the 5 years of the SUCCESS project research, this set of actual problems has been considered and analysed under the principle of sustainability: "What to maintain?" "What to change?" were the overall research questions asked in the SUCCESS project; the researchers were looking for answers under a sustainability regime, respecting the need to raise the quality of life in the villages. Several interweaving processes were used to achieve results: the inter-disciplinary research process between many areas of expertise, the trans-disciplinary process between the researchers and the Chinese villagers, and a negotiation process that made the connection between these two processes. The introduction describes the basic sustainability definition that was orienting the whole study. The innovation lays mostly in the methodology: the inter-disciplinary research co-operation related to practice and to involving the affected communities is needed to manage the significant and growing imbalances between urban and rural areas regarding their sustainability. In the transdisciplinary work, the project developed "village future sentences" that describe the local outcome of the research as one step towards better theoretical understanding of the mechanisms that could lead to a sustainable future, and they also managed to start sustainability processes in the case study sites. The integrated approach of the project helped generating future scenarios for these villages covering all aspects of their development, including urban design issues. Out of these scenarios, the villages developed small projects that could be implemented during the research period. This work made an important impact on community thinking within these villages. However, it can also be seen as contributing to the dramatically changing development process in China, by finding a balance between traditional and contemporary approaches. In particular, the approach demonstrated a new, inter-disciplinary and trans-disciplinary negotiation processes whereby the local knowledge and the expert knowledge find common ground and outcomes. The article follows the hypothesis that only comprehensive concepts can contribute to an upgraded living standard, where living spaces and rural life should be recognised and esteemed in the future as a complement to urban lifestyles within the Chinese society. Innovative knowledge generation-such as the "systemic structure constellation" technique or the systems model approach-helped to bring out latent needs, hopes and potential of the villagers. Besides the practical usage of these implemented projects, the process leading there showed the stakeholders their own fields of action. One major impact of these projects is the visibility of the results, which is crucial for villagers' awareness, their self-confidence and their experience with a successful participation in decision-making processes. Another impact is the potential for replicating results of sustainability-oriented patterns throughout China, especially as three of the villages have been nominated official model villages. Scenarios of a sustainable future for Chinese villages were the objective of the SUCCESS project. The first condition for this future is the question whether they can persist into the future-and to picture the importance of the rural environment and living space as a relevant element of Chinese life that needs to get a better image and more attention from the authorities and from the public opinion. Therefore, the final sentence that the whole research consortium, composed of 17 scientific institutions from European Union and China, agreed upon as a common result for the SUCCESS project, is as follows: "China is composed of a rich diversity of villages with many attractive qualities and essential resources for the future growth of the whole country; we recommend that policy makers cherish the human and natural potential of the rural economy and environment so that villages provide the foundation for sustainable development of this progressive nation" [Dumreicher, H., 2006. SUCCESS-a sustainable future for Chinese villages. International Symposium "Chinese Villages and their Sustainable Future", University of Natural Resources and Applied Life Sciences, Vienna, January 16]. This sentence was used in papers that where sent to different Chinese authorities by the Chinese partners and found its way, as a sort of "unofficial Charta", towards governmental agencies at national and provincial levels. The team carried out a 5-year-research study in rural China, aiming at establishing future images under the premises of sustainability. But the basic topic that needed to be tackled with was the question whether at all those villages could persist in the coming decades of rapid development. Therefore, the first aim of the study was to establish the importance of the rural environment and living space as a basis for the future of China.
17889044	Seasonal variation in glucosinolate content in Brassica oleracea crops grown in northwestern Spain.	Brassica oleracea L. crops including kales, cabbages, and Tronchuda cabbages are widely grown in northwestern Spain and Portugal but little information is available on leaf glucosinolate content of these crops. The objectives were to determine the diversity for the total glucosinolate content and profile on leaves in a collection of 153 kales, 26 cabbages, and three Tronchuda cabbages varieties grown at two growing seasons and to determine the seasonal variation of glucosinolates in cabbages and Tronchuda cabbage varieties. Sinigrin, glucoiberin, and glucobrassicin were the major glucosinolates found in kales. Glucoiberin was the most common glucosinolate in Tronchuda cabbages in both planting seasons and in cabbages sown in fall season whereas glucobrassicin and glucoiberin were the most common glucosinolates in cabbages in spring season. In kales the total glucosinolate content ranged from 11.0 to 53 micromol g(-1) dw, with a mean value of 26.3 micromol g(-1) dw. Four kale varieties (MBG-BRS0468, MBG-BRS0476, MBG-BRS0060 and MBG-BRS0223) showed the highest total sinigrin or glucobrassicin contents. So, they could be good candidates for future breeding programs. In cabbages, the total glucosinolate content ranged from 10.9 to 27 g(-1) dw. Total glucosinolate concentration during spring sowing (22 micro mg(-1) dw) was higher than those in fall sowing (13 micro mg(-1) dw). Regarding both high glucosinolate content and the agronomic value, MBG-BRS0057 and MBG-BRS0074 could be good sources of beneficial glucosinolates. The presence of high concentrations of sinigrin, glucoiberin, and glucobrassicin warrant further search into their potential use to enhance the level of these important phytochemicals in these edible crops.
17889980	In vivo genotoxicity of mercury chloride and lead acetate: Micronucleus test on acridine orange stained fish cells.	The genotoxic effects of mercury chloride and lead acetate were evaluated in vivo using the micronucleus (MN) assay on acridine-orange (AO) stained peripheral blood erythrocytes, gill and fin epithelial cells of Carassius auratus auratus. Fish were exposed to three different concentrations of mercury chloride (MC) (1 microg/, 5 microg/L and 10 microg/L) and lead acetate (LA) (10 microg/L, 50 microg/L and 100 microg/L) for 2, 4 and 6 days. A single dose of 5 mg/L cyclophosphamide was used as a positive control. In addition to micronuclei, nuclear buds (NBs) were assessed in the erythrocytes. The ratio of polychromatic and normochromatic erythrocytes (PCE/NCE) in peripheral blood was also evaluated to assess cytotoxicity. MN frequencies in all three tissues were elevated in fish exposed to both LA and MC. However, NBs showed different sensitivity to metal treatments. MN frequencies in both control and treated fish were highest in gill cells and generally lower in erythrocytes and fin cells. PCE/NCE rations decreased in relation to MC and LA treatments. The results of this study indicate that LA and MC have genotoxic and cytotoxic damage in fish and confirmed that AO staining is a suitable technique for in vivo MN test in fish.
17892888	Antioxidant aryl-prenylcoumarin, flavan-3-ols and flavonoids from Eysenhardtia subcoriacea.	Antioxidant activity (AOA) assay-guided chemical analysis, using a rat pancreas homogenate model, of aerial parts from Eysenhardtia subcoriacea, led to isolation of the new compound subcoriacin (3-(2'-hydroxy-4',5'-methylendioxyphenyl)-6-(3''-hydroxymethyl-4''-hydroxybut-2''-enyl)-7-hydroxycoumarin) together with the known substances: (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, (+)-afzelechin, eriodictyol, (+)-catechin 3-O-beta-D-galactopyranoside and quercetin 3-O-beta-D-galactopyranoside as bioactive constituents. The structure of the compound was determined from 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopic analyses. Additional known constituents were characterized. The bioactive compounds showed also moderate to strong radical scavenging properties against diphenylpicrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH). In addition, subcoriacin, (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin and (+)-afzelechin improved the reduced glutathione levels in rat pancreatic homogenate.
17893877	The activities of progesterone receptor isoform A and B are differentially modulated by their ligands in a gene-selective manner.	It is known that progesterone receptor (PR) isoform A (PR-A) and isoform B (PR-B) may mediate different effects of progesterone. The objective of this study was to determine if the functions of PR isoforms also vary in response to different PR modulators (PRM). The effects of 7 synthetic PRM were tested in MDA-MB-231 cells engineered to express PR-A, PR-B, or both PR isoforms. The effects of progesterone were similar in cells expressing PR-A or PR-B in which it inhibited growth and induced focal adhesion. On the other hand, synthetic PRM modulated the activity of the PR isoforms differently. RU486, CDB4124, 17alpha-hydroxy CDB4124 and VA2914 exerted agonist activities on cell growth and adhesion via PR-B. Via PR-A, however, these compounds displayed agonist effect on cell growth but induced stellate morphology which was distinct from the agonist's effect. Their dual properties via PR-A were also displayed at the gene expression level: the compounds acted as agonists on cell cycle genes but exhibited antagonistic effect on cell adhesion genes. Introduction of ERalpha by adenoviral vector to these cells did not change PR-A or PR-B mediated effect of PRM radically, but it causes significant cell rounding and modified the magnitudes of the responses to PRM. The findings suggest that the activities of PR isoforms may be modulated by different PRM through gene-specific regulatory mechanisms. This raises an interesting possibility that PRM may be designed to be PR isoform and cellular pathway selective to achieve targeted therapy in breast cancer.
17897831	Arthroscopic treatment of patellofemoral soft tissue impingement after posterior stabilized total knee arthroplasty.	Patellar clunk syndrome is due to a suprapatellar fibrous nodule which develops at the junction between the proximal patella and the quadriceps tendon after total knee arthroplasty. Twelve patients (12 knees) who underwent arthroscopic treatment for the painful patellar crepitus or clunk after total knee arthroplasty had been followed at least for 1 year were enrolled. The average onset of symptom was 10.2 months (from 3 to 21 months) after total knee arthroplasty. All of the patients presented a painful crepitus, catching or clunk at the proximal patella, especially climbing stairs or rising from sitting. Both radiographic and clinical evaluations were done and for the clinical assessment, Knee Society Scores were recorded preoperatively and postoperatively. On their radiographic assessment, there was no evidence of component failure and in only one patient, joint line was elevated more than 8 mm. On arthroscopic examination, hypertrophic synovial tissue was identified at the junction of patella and quadriceps tendon in all patients. The hypertrophic synovial tissue did not engage completely in the intercondylar notch during flexion, but on extension, the lesion impinged on the distal part of anterior flange of femoral component at about 30 degrees to 40 degrees of knee flexion. On clinical assessment at the latest follow-up, the average knee score and function score increased from 63.8+/-4.6 to 90.9+/-3.2, 65.4+/-3.2 to 90.4+/-4.3 respectively. Arthroscopic debridement for soft tissue impingement at the patellofemoral joint following total knee arthroplasty showed satisfactory results.
17898323	MRI patterns of atrophy associated with progression to AD in amnestic mild cognitive impairment.	OBJECTIVE: To compare the patterns of gray matter loss in subjects with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) who progress to Alzheimer disease (AD) within a fixed clinical follow-up time vs those who remain stable. METHODS: Twenty-one subjects with aMCI were identified from the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer's research program who remained clinically stable for their entire observed clinical course (aMCI-S), where the minimum required follow-up time from MRI to last follow-up assessment was 3 years. These subjects were age- and gender-matched to 42 aMCI subjects who progressed to AD within 18 months of the MRI (aMCI-P). Each subject was then age- and gender-matched to a control subject. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was used to assess patterns of gray matter atrophy in the aMCI-P and aMCI-S groups compared to the control group, and compared to each other. RESULTS: The aMCI-P group showed bilateral loss affecting the medial and inferior temporal lobe, temporoparietal association neocortex, and frontal lobes, compared to controls. The aMCI-S group showed no regions of gray matter loss when compared to controls. When the aMCI-P and aMCI-S groups were compared directly, the aMCI-P group showed greater loss in the medial and inferior temporal lobes, the temporoparietal neocortex, posterior cingulate, precuneus, anterior cingulate, and frontal lobes than the aMCI-S group. CONCLUSIONS: The regions of loss observed in subjects with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) who progressed to Alzheimer disease (AD) within 18 months of the MRI are typical of subjects with AD. The lack of gray matter loss in subjects with aMCI who remained clinically stable for their entire observed clinical course is consistent with the notion that patterns of atrophy on MRI at baseline map well onto the subsequent clinical course.
17898419	Systematic association studies of mitochondrial DNA variations in schizophrenia: focus on the ND5 gene.	Postmortem studies, as well as genetic association studies, have implicated mitochondrial dysfunction in schizophrenia (SZ). We conducted multistaged analysis to assess the involvement of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variations in SZ. Initially, the entire mtDNA genome was sequenced in pools of DNA from SZ cases and controls (n = 180 in each group, set 1). Two polymorphisms localized to the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 (ND5) gene demonstrated suggestive case control allele frequency differences (mtDNA 13368 G/A, p = .019 and mtDNA 13708G/A, p = .043). Hence, the ND5 gene was sequenced in individual samples from the initial panel of cases and controls. Additional subjects from another independent set of cases and controls (set 2, cases, n = 244, controls n = 508) were also sequenced individually. No significant differences in allele frequencies for mtDNA 13368 G/A, and mtDNA 13708G/A were observed. However, we identified 216 other rare variants, 53 of which were reported earlier in association studies of other mitochondrial disorders. We compared the distribution of polymorphisms in both sets of cases and controls. No significant case-control differences were observed in the smaller, first set. In the second set, cases had more variants overall (p = 0.014), as well as synonymous variants (p = 0.02), but the difference for nonsynonymous variants was not significant (p = 0.19). Screening available first-degree relatives (n = 10) revealed 10 maternally inherited variations, suggesting that not all the variants are somatic mutations. Further investigations are warranted.
17899098	Constitutive overexpression of a stress-inducible small GTP-binding protein PgRab7 from Pennisetum glaucum enhances abiotic stress tolerance in transgenic tobacco.	The Rab GTPases are important components of endocytic network in plant cells. Endocytosis participates in the cell's reaction to extracellular stimuli by desensitizing, down-regulating or recycling receptors and membrane proteins. Rab7 is a small GTP-binding protein involved in intracellular vesicle trafficking from late endosome to the vacuole. We have isolated Rab7 cDNA from Pennisetum glaucum, a relatively drought-stress tolerant food grain crop grown commonly in India, during cDNA-subtractive hybridization of dehydration-stress treated plants. The PgRab7 ORF, encoding 207 aminoacids, was over-expressed in E. coli. The recombinant PgRab7 protein showed GTP-binding and GTPase activity. Transcript expression of PgRab7 gene was differentially up-regulated by different environmental stimuli such as cold, dehydration and NaCl and also by a plant hormone IAA. Overexpression of PgRab7 gene enhanced tolerance to NaCl and mannitol in transgenic tobacco. Transgenic plants also had increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. These results show that PgRab7 is a potential candidate gene for developing both salinity and dehydration tolerance in planta.
17899152	Estimating the age of immature Chrysomya albiceps (Diptera: Calliphoridae), correcting for temperature and geographical latitude.	Developmental curves for Chrysomya albiceps (Wiedemann) (Diptera: Calliphoridae) were established at 13 different constant temperatures using developmental landmarks and length as measures of age. The thermal summation constants (K) and developmental zeros (D (0)) were calculated for five developmental landmarks using the method described by Ikemoto and Takai (Environ Entomol 29:671-682, 2000). Comparison with the K and D (0) values of our findings to those of three previously published studies of C. albiceps suggests that K is directly proportional to geographic latitude, and D (0) is inversely proportional to both K and geographic latitude. Body size and developmental landmarks have a complex relationship because of trade-offs between mortality risk and female fecundity (as measured by body size) at non-optimal temperatures. This relationship can be summarized using superimposed isomorphen and isomegalen diagrams, which can then be used to make forensic estimates of postmortem intervals from larval body lengths. Finally, we recommend that future studies providing data for precise forensic estimates of postmortem intervals should use a relative temporal precision of about 10% of the total duration being measured. For many blowflies, this translates into a sampling interval of approximately every 2 h before hatching, 3 h before first ecdysis and 6 h before second ecdysis.
17899260	Cadmium-induced siderophore production by a high Cd-resistant bacterial strain relieved Cd toxicity in plants through root colonization.	This study focuses on the isolation and characterization of a high cadmium (Cd)-resistant bacterial strain, and possible exploitation of its Cd-accumulation and Cd-induced siderophore production property to improve plant growth in cadmium-contaminated soil through root colonization. The bacterial strain could tolerate up to 8 mM of Cd and could accumulate Cd intracellularly. The strain showed Cd-induced siderophore production maximally at 1.75 mM of Cd concentration under culture condition. It stimulated the growth of mustard and pumpkin plants in Cd-added soil through its establishment in rhizosphere. Through biochemical characterization and 16S rDNA sequence analysis, the strain KUCd1, as the name given to it, was identified as a strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
17899370	Differential gene expression profile in breast cancer-derived stromal fibroblasts.	BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is characterized by malignant transformation of epithelial cells, but stromal cells also play an important role in tumorigenesis. While tumor-derived fibroblasts display unique phenotypic properties, it is unclear whether they also represent are a specific subpopulation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Stromal fibroblasts deriving from malignant tissue of 10 women with invasive breast cancer, and from normal breast tissue of 10 women with benign breast disorders, were subjected to differential complementary DNA Microarray Analysis by using a 2,400 gene cDNA array. Individual gene expression pattern were confirmed by RT-PCR. RESULTS: In a cDNA array that allows to analyze the differential gene expression of more than 2,400 genes, the mRNA expression of 135 genes were increased more than 2 fold in fibroblasts from malignant breast tumors. The majority of these genes encode tumor-promoting cytokines, transcription factors and cell-matrix associated proteins. The mRNA expression of 110 genes decreased to less than 0.5 fold. The remaining 2,155 genes were not significantly altered. RT-PCR performed on individual biopsies from breast cancer and normal breast tissues confirmed the validity of the pooled gene expression signature. CONCLUSION: Breast cancer-derived stromal fibroblasts show a distinctive gene expression pattern that differentiates them from normal breast stroma. Our observation of increased expression of tumor promotion-associated genes even in the absence of adjacent malignant epithelium suggests that tumor stroma is comprised of a fibroblastic subpopulation that provides for a microenvironment which supports tumor growth and invasion.
17899413	Seasonal variations in the relationship between landscape pattern and land surface temperature in Indianapolis, USA.	This paper intended to examine the seasonal variations in the relationship between landscape pattern and land surface temperature based on a case study of Indianapolis, United States. The integration of remote sensing, GIS, and landscape ecology methods was used in this study. Four Terra's ASTER images were used to derive the landscape patterns and land surface temperatures (LST) in four seasons in the study area. The spatial and ecological characteristics of landscape patterns and LSTs were examined by the use of landscape metrics. The impact of each land use and land cover type on LST was analyzed based on the measurements of landscape metrics. The results show that the landscape and LST patterns in the winter were unique. The rest of three seasons apparently had more agreeable landscape and LST patterns. The spatial configuration of each LST zone conformed to that of each land use and land cover type with more than 50% of overlap in area for all seasons. This paper may provide useful information for urban planners and environmental managers for assessing and monitoring urban thermal environments as result of urbanization.
17899450	On using ethical theories to teach engineering ethics.	Many engineering ethics classes and textbooks introduce theories such as utilitarianism and Kantianism (and most others draw from these theories without mentioning them explicitly). Yet using ethical theories to teach engineering ethics is not devoid of difficulty. First, their status is unclear (should one pick a single theory or use them all? does it make a difference?) Also, textbooks generally assume or fallaciously 'prove' that egoism (or even simply accounting for one's interests) is wrong. Further, the drawbacks of ethical theories are underestimated and the theories are also otherwise misrepresented to make them more suitable for engineering ethics as the authors construe it, viz. the 'moral reasoning' process. Stating in what various theories disagree would allow the students to frame the problem more productively in terms of motive-consequence or society-individual dichotomies rather than in terms of Kant-utilitarian.
17900271	Global phylogeography of marine Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus reveals a distinct partitioning of lineages among oceanic biomes.	Marine cyanobacteria of the genera Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus are important contributors to global primary production occupying a key position at the base of marine food webs. The genetically diverse nature of each genus is likely an important reason for their successful colonization of vast tracts of the world's oceans, a feature that has led to detailed analysis of the distribution of these genetic lineages at the local and ocean basin scale. Here, we extend these analyses to the global dimension, using new data from cruises in the Pacific, Indian and Arctic Oceans in combination with data from previous studies in the Atlantic Ocean, Arabian Sea, Red Sea and a circumnavigation of the southern hemisphere to form a data set which comprises most of the world's major ocean systems. We show that the distribution patterns of Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus lineages are remarkably similar in different ocean systems with comparable environmental conditions, but producing a strikingly different 'signature' in the four major ocean domains or biomes (the Polar Domain, Coastal Boundary Domain, Trade Winds Domain and Westerly Winds Domain). This clearly reiterates the idea of spatial partitioning of individual cyanobacterial lineages, but at the global scale.
17900276	DCS-1, DCS-2, and DFV share amino acid substitutions at the extracellular RhD protein vestibule.	BACKGROUND: RhD and RhCE are structurally related to ammonium transporter proteins, yet their physiologic function remains unclear. Recent three-dimensional homology modeling with Escherichia coli AmtB as a template defined a putative transmembraneous channel. Three RhD variants with amino acid substitutions located at the extracellular channel aperture are described. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Blood samples were selected because of serologic abnormalities. RHD, RHCE, and LW nucleotide sequences were determined from genomic DNA. D epitope patterns were established with monoclonal anti-D panels. Three-dimensional Rh structures were calculated by alignment to AmtB. RESULTS: The RHD allele DCS-1 was found to carry the two amino acid substitutions F223V (667T > G) and A226P (676G > C) caused by missense mutations in RHD exon 5. This study compared DCS-1 with the D variants DFV (F223V) and DCS-2 (A226P), harboring solely one or the other of the two substitutions. All three D variants were associated with a cDE haplotype. The antigen densities were approximately 3,000 D antigens per red blood cell for DCS-1, 800 for DCS-2, and 9,300 for DFV. DCS-1 and DCS-2 were partial D, because they lacked distinct epitopes. DFV presented as an almost normal D phenotype; the sample contained allo-anti-LW(a). The D(w) antigen was absent from DCS-1, DFV, and DAU-4, but expressed by DAU-5. CONCLUSION: DCS-1, DCS-2, and DFV carry amino acid substitutions at the extracellular vestibule, visualized by 3-dimensional modeling. Proline at position 226 greatly influenced the D antigen density and may reduce the RhD membrane integration. Although the F223V substitution is regarded as the initial event in the evolution of the weak D Type 4 cluster, the current DFV allele probably evolved independently, as evident from different RHCE haplotypes.
17900277	Correlation between serology and genetics of weak D types in Denmark.	BACKGROUND: To date more than 100 variant D types have been reported and the frequencies vary among populations. Blood donor typing should reveal all donors expressing D antigens, while patient typing should prevent the development of anti-D in patients with a D- or variant D blood type. Serotyping is the standard method to assign transfusion strategies, whereas molecular classification offers a more specific grouping of weak and partial D. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Blood donor and patient samples with discrepant results of D phenotyping were collected to investigate the frequency of weak D subtypes in Denmark and to evaluate currently used serologic methods. RESULTS: Nine different weak D types were identified among the 101 samples. Weak D Types 1, 2, and 3 constituted 80 percent of the analyzed samples and 10 percent of the samples identified as weak D from serology were actually partial D. CONCLUSION: The distribution of weak D types in Denmark was found to resemble the distribution in Northern Germany in respect to the three most prevalent weak D types. Correctly defining all samples that show weak reactions in D typing as weak D or partial D is not possible with serotyping alone; genotyping offers the only exact categorization. Serology is superior for routine blood typing, however.
17901128	Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) tyrosine phosphorylation regulates binding of FGFR substrate 2alpha (FRS2alpha) but not FRS2 to the receptor.	Binding of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) to the FGF receptor (FGFR) tyrosine kinase leads to receptor tyrosine autophosphorylation as well as phosphorylation of multiple downstream signaling molecules that are recruited to the receptor either by direct binding or through adaptor proteins. The FGFR substrate 2 (FRS2) family consists of two members, FRS2alpha and FRS2beta, and has been shown to recruit multiple signaling molecules, including Grb2 and Shp2, to FGFR1. To better understand how FRS2 interacted with FGFR1, in vivo binding assays with coexpressed FGFR1 and FRS2 recombinant proteins in mammalian cells were carried out. The results showed that the interaction of full-length FRS2alpha, but not FRS2beta, with FGFR1 was enhanced by activation of the receptor kinase. The truncated FRS2alpha mutant that was comprised only of the phosphotyrosine-binding domain (PTB) bound FGFR1 constitutively, suggesting that the C-terminal sequence downstream the PTB domain inhibited the PTB-FGFR1 binding. Inactivation of the FGFR1 kinase and substitutions of tyrosine phosphorylation sites of FGFR1, but not FRS2alpha, reduced binding of FGFR1 with FRS2alpha. The results suggest that although the tyrosine autophosphorylation sites of FGFR1 did not constitute the binding sites for FRS2alpha, phosphorylation of these residues was essential for optimal interaction with FRS2alpha. In addition, it was demonstrated that the Grb2-binding sites of FRS2alpha are essential for mediating signals of FGFR1 to activate the FiRE enhancer of the mouse syndecan 1 gene. The results, for the first time, demonstrate the specific signals mediated by the Grb2-binding sites and further our understanding of FGF signal transmission at the adaptor level.
17901249	Highly penetrant myeloproliferative disease in the Ts65Dn mouse model of Down syndrome.	Children with Down syndrome (DS) display macrocytosis, thrombocytosis, and a 500-fold increased risk of developing megakaryocytic leukemia; however, the specific effects of trisomy 21 on hematopoiesis remain poorly defined. To study this question, we analyzed blood cell development in the Ts65Dn mouse model of DS. Ts65Dn mice are trisomic for 104 orthologs of Hsa21 genes and are the most widely used mouse model for DS. We discovered that Ts65Dn mice display persistent macrocytosis and develop a myeloproliferative disease (MPD) characterized by profound thrombocytosis, megakaryocyte hyperplasia, dysplastic megakaryocyte morphology, and myelofibrosis. In addition, these animals bear distorted hematopoietic stem and myeloid progenitor cell compartments compared with euploid control littermates. Of the 104 trisomic genes in Ts65Dn mice, Aml1/Runx1 attracts considerable attention as a candidate oncogene in DS-acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (DS-AMKL). To determine whether trisomy for Aml1/Runx1 is essential for MPD, we restored disomy at the Aml1/Runx1 locus in the Ts65Dn strain. Surprisingly, trisomy for Aml1/Runx1 is not required for megakaryocyte hyperplasia and myelofibrosis, suggesting that trisomy for one or more of the remaining genes can promote this disease. Our studies demonstrate the potential of DS mouse models to improve our understanding of chromosome 21 gene dosage effects in human hematologic malignancies.
17903216	Diversity and phylogeny of Baltic Sea picocyanobacteria inferred from their ITS and phycobiliprotein operons.	Picocyanobacteria of the genus Synechococcus span a range of different colours, from red strains rich in phycoerythrin (PE) to green strains rich in phycocyanin (PC). Here, we show that coexistence of red and green picocyanobacteria in the Baltic Sea is widespread. The diversity and phylogeny of red and green picocyanobacteria was analysed using three different genes: 16S rRNA-ITS, the cpeBA operon of the red PE pigment and the cpcBA operon of the green PC pigment. Sequencing of 209 clones showed that Baltic Sea picocyanobacteria exhibit high levels of microdiversity. The partial nucleotide sequences of the cpcBA and cpeBA operons from the clone libraries of the Baltic Sea revealed two distinct phylogenetic clades: one clade containing mainly sequences from cultured PC-rich picocyanobacteria, while the other contains only sequences from cultivated PE-rich strains. A third clade of phycourobilin (PUB) containing strains of PE-rich Synechococcus spp. did not contain sequences from the Baltic Sea clone libraries. These findings differ from previously published phylogenies based on 16S rRNA gene analysis. Our data suggest that, in terms of their pigmentation, Synechococcus spp. represent three different lineages occupying different ecological niches in the underwater light spectrum. Strains from different lineages can coexist in light environments that overlap with their light absorption spectra.
17904271	Environmental implications for disaster preparedness: lessons learnt from the Indian Ocean Tsunami.	The impact of disasters, whether natural or man-made, not only has human dimensions, but environmental ones as well. Environmental conditions may exacerbate the impact of a disaster, and vice versa, disasters tend to have an impact on the environment. Deforestation, forest management practices, or agriculture systems can worsen the negative environmental impacts of a storm or typhoon, leading to landslides, flooding, silting, and ground/surface water contamination. We have only now come to understand these cyclical causes and impacts and realize that taking care of our natural resources and managing them wisely not only assures that future generations will be able to live in sustainable ways, but also reduces the risks that natural and man-made hazards pose to people living today. Emphasizing and reinforcing the centrality of environmental concerns in disaster management has become a critical priority, requiring the sound management of natural resources as a tool to prevent disasters and lessen their impacts on people, their homes, and livelihoods. As the horrors of the Asian tsunami of December 2004 continue to be evaluated, and people in the region slowly attempt to build a semblance of normalcy, we have to look to the lessons learnt from the tsunami disaster as an opportunity to prepare ourselves better for future disasters. This article focuses on findings and lessons learnt on the environmental aspects of the tsunami, and its implications on disaster preparedness plans. This article essentially emphasizes the cyclical interrelations between environments and disasters, by studying the findings and assessments of the recent Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami that struck on 26 December 2004. It specifically looks at four key affected countries--Maldives, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, and Thailand.
17904518	Proteome of the Escherichia coli envelope and technological challenges in membrane proteome analysis.	The envelope of Escherichia coli is a complex organelle composed of the outer membrane, periplasm-peptidoglycan layer and cytoplasmic membrane. Each compartment has a unique complement of proteins, the proteome. Determining the proteome of the envelope is essential for developing an in silico bacterial model, for determining cellular responses to environmental alterations, for determining the function of proteins encoded by genes of unknown function and for development and testing of new experimental technologies such as mass spectrometric methods for identifying and quantifying hydrophobic proteins. The availability of complete genomic information has led several groups to develop computer algorithms to predict the proteome of each part of the envelope by searching the genome for leader sequences, beta-sheet motifs and stretches of alpha-helical hydrophobic amino acids. In addition, published experimental data has been mined directly and by machine learning approaches. In this review we examine the somewhat confusing available literature and relate published experimental data to the most recent gene annotation of E. coli to describe the predicted and experimental proteome of each compartment. The problem of characterizing integral versus membrane-associated proteins is discussed. The E. coli envelope proteome provides an excellent test bed for developing mass spectrometric techniques for identifying hydrophobic proteins that have generally been refractory to analysis. We describe the gel based and solution based proteome analysis approaches along with protein cleavage and proteolysis methods that investigators are taking to tackle this difficult problem.
17904607	Removal of a N-linked glycosylation site of classical swine fever virus strain Brescia Erns glycoprotein affects virulence in swine.	E(rns) glycoprotein, along with E(1) and E(2), is one of the three envelope glycoproteins of classical swine fever virus (CSFV). E(rns) is a heavily glycosylated protein involved in several functions, including virus attachment and entry to target cells, production of neutralizing antibodies, and virulence. The role of added glycans to CSFV strain Brescia E(rns) on virus virulence was assessed in swine. A panel of virus mutants was constructed and used to investigate whether the removal of each of seven putative glycosylation sites in the E(rns) glycoprotein would affect viral virulence in swine. Only N269A/Q substitution rendered attenuated viruses (N1v/N1Qv) that, unlike BICv and other mutants, produced a transient infection in swine characterized by mild symptoms and decreased virus shedding. Notably, N1v efficiently protected swine from challenge with virulent BICv at 3 and 21 days post-infection suggesting that glycosylation of E(rns) could be modified for development of CSF live-attenuated vaccines.
17904882	Electrochemotherapy for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma in cats: a preliminary report.	Squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) of the skin are commonly described in cats. Reported treatments include surgery, radiation therapy and photodynamic therapy. This preliminary study reports on the management of these lesions combining the local administration of bleomycin (plus hyaluronidase for a more uniform distribution) with permeabilizing biphasic electric pulses. Nine cats with SCC graded T(2)-T(4) were treated over a 5 year period, and each cat received two sessions of electrochemotherapy (ECT) 1 week apart. The side effects of this treatment were minimal and limited to mild erythema of the nose. Seven of the cats (77.7%) had a complete response lasting up to 3 years. ECT seems to be a safe and effective option for the treatment of feline sun-induced squamous cell carcinomas and warrants further investigation.
17905509	Alternative ends: telomeres and meiosis.	Meiosis is a specialized type of cell division that halves the diploid number of chromosomes, yielding four haploid nuclei. Dramatic changes in chromosomal organization occur within the nucleus at the beginning of meiosis which are followed by the separation of homologous chromosomes at the first meiotic division. This is the case for telomeres that display a meiotic-specific behavior with gathering in a limited sector of the nuclear periphery. This leads to a characteristic polarized chromosomal configuration, called the "bouquet" arrangement. The widespread phenomenon of bouquet formation among eukaryotes has led to the hypothesis that it is functionally linked to the process of interactions between homologous chromosomes that are a unique feature of meiosis and are essential for proper chromosome segregation. Various studies in different model organisms have questioned the role of the telomere bouquet in chromosome pairing and recombination, and very recently in meiotic spindle formation, and have provided some clues about the molecular mechanisms that carry out this specific clustering of telomeres.
17905612	Insights from clinical studies into the role of the MLL gene in infant and childhood leukemia.	Translocations involving the Mixed Lineage Leukemia (MLL) gene at 11q23 are found in both acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML), but have different prognostic implications depending on the phenotype of the leukemia in de novo pediatric cases. The majority of MLL gene rearrangements are associated with infant ALL, and their presence predicts a poor prognosis which worsens with earlier age of presentation. Rearrangements of the MLL gene are found in most cases of infant AML and regardless of age confer an intermediate risk. The treatment of MLL-rearranged ALL in children involves increased intensification of chemotherapy, and infants with ALL are treated with an intensive regimen of ALL- and AML-like chemotherapy, with the proportion of MLL-rearranged cases being responsible for the poor outcome in this age group. The use of DNA microarray analysis to distinguish a particular gene signature for MLL-rearranged leukemias is shedding light on the molecular mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets of these leukemias. It may also prove to have a useful role in both diagnosis and prognosis. This review considers recent advances in our understanding of the role of MLL gene rearrangements in pediatric clinical practice.
17905794	Computational methods for the comparative quantification of proteins in label-free LCn-MS experiments.	Liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to electrospray mass spectrometry (MS) is well established in high-throughput proteomics. The technology enables rapid identification of large numbers of proteins in a relatively short time. Comparative quantification of identified proteins from different samples is often regarded as the next step in proteomics experiments enabling the comparison of protein expression in different proteomes. Differential labeling of samples using stable isotope incorporation or conjugation is commonly used to compare protein levels between samples but these procedures are difficult to carry out in the laboratory and for large numbers of samples. Recently, comparative quantification of label-free LC(n)-MS proteomics data has emerged as an alternative approach. In this review, we discuss different computational approaches for extracting comparative quantitative information from label-free LC(n)-MS proteomics data. The procedure for computationally recovering the quantitative information is described. Furthermore, statistical tests used to evaluate the relevance of results will also be discussed.
17909759	Elemental mass spectrometry for quantitative proteomics.	In the last decade mass-spectrometry-based proteomics has become an indispensable analytical tool for molecular biology, cellular biology and, lately, for the emerging systems biology. This review summarises the evolution and great potential of analytical methods based on elemental mass-spectrometric detection for quantitative proteomic analysis.
17912248	The DISC locus in psychiatric illness.	The DISC locus is located at the breakpoint of a balanced t(1;11) chromosomal translocation in a large and unique Scottish family. This translocation segregates in a highly statistically significant manner with a broad diagnosis of psychiatric illness, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depression, as well as with a narrow diagnosis of schizophrenia alone. Two novel genes were identified at this locus and due to the high prevalence of schizophrenia in this family, they were named Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia-1 (DISC1) and Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia-2 (DISC2). DISC1 encodes a novel multifunctional scaffold protein, whereas DISC2 is a putative noncoding RNA gene antisense to DISC1. A number of independent genetic linkage and association studies in diverse populations support the original linkage findings in the Scottish family and genetic evidence now implicates the DISC locus in susceptibility to schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder and major depression as well as various cognitive traits. Despite this, with the exception of the t(1;11) translocation, robust evidence for a functional variant(s) is still lacking and genetic heterogeneity is likely. Of the two genes identified at this locus, DISC1 has been prioritized as the most probable candidate susceptibility gene for psychiatric illness, as its protein sequence is directly disrupted by the translocation. Much research has been undertaken in recent years to elucidate the biological functions of the DISC1 protein and to further our understanding of how it contributes to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. These data are the main subject of this review; however, the potential involvement of DISC2 in the pathogenesis of psychiatric illness is also discussed. A detailed picture of DISC1 function is now emerging, which encompasses roles in neurodevelopment, cytoskeletal function and cAMP signalling, and several DISC1 interactors have also been defined as independent genetic susceptibility factors for psychiatric illness. DISC1 is a hub protein in a multidimensional risk pathway for major mental illness, and studies of this pathway are opening up opportunities for a better understanding of causality and possible mechanisms of intervention.
17912554	Familial hematuria.	Hematuria is a common presenting complaint in pediatric nephrology clinics and often has a familial basis. This teaching article provides an overview of causes, diagnosis, and management of the major forms of familial hematuria, Alport syndrome, and thin basement membrane nephropathy.
17913285	Treatment with salicylic acid decreases the effect of cadmium on photosynthesis in maize plants.	The present study investigated the possible mediatory role of salicylic acid (SA) in protecting photosynthesis from cadmium (Cd) toxicity. Seeds of maize (Zea mays L., hybrid Norma) were sterilized and divided into two groups. Half of the seeds were presoaked in 500 microM SA solution for only 6h, after which both groups were allowed to germinate for 3d and were then grown for 14d in Hoagland solution at 22/18 degrees C in a 16/8-h light/dark period and 120 micromolm(-2)s(-1) PAR. All seedlings (without H(2)O and SA controls) were transferred to Cd-containing solutions (10, 15, and 25 microM) and grown for 14d. The rate of CO(2) fixation and the activity of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (RuBPC, EC 4.1.1.39) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC, EC 4.1.1.31) were measured. Changes in the levels of several important parameters associated with oxidative stress, namely H(2)O(2) and proline production, lipid peroxidation, electrolyte leakage, and the activities of antioxidative enzymes (superoxide dismutase (SOD, EC 1.15.1.1), ascorbate peroxidase (APX, EC 1.11.1.11), catalase (CAT, EC 1.11.1.6), and guaiacol peroxidase (POD, EC 1.11.1.7)) were measured. Exposure of the plants to Cd caused a gradual decrease in the shoot and root dry weight accumulation, with the effect being most pronounced at 25 microM Cd. Seed pretreatment with SA alleviated the negative effect of Cd on plant growth parameters. The same tendency was observed for the chlorophyll level. The rate of CO(2) fixation was lower in Cd-treated plants, and the inhibition was partially overcome in SA-pretreated plants. A drop in the activities of RuBPC and PEPC was observed for Cd-treated plants. Pretreatment with SA alleviated the inhibitory effect of Cd on enzyme activity. Proline production and the rates of lipid peroxidation and electrolyte leakage increased in Cd-treated plants, whereas the values of these parameters were much lower in SA-pretreated plants. Treatment of plants with Cd decreased APX activity, but more than doubled SOD activity. Pretreatment with SA caused an increase in both APX and SOD activity, but caused a strong reduction in CAT activity. The data suggest that SA may protect cells against oxidative damage and photosynthesis against Cd toxicity.
17913288	The protective role of selenium in rape seedlings subjected to cadmium stress.	The effect of selenium (Se) on rape (Brassica napus) seedlings subjected to cadmium (Cd) stress was studied in vitro by investigating plant growth and changes in fatty acid composition, activity of antioxidative enzymes and DNA methylation pattern. Physiological experiments were carried out on seedlings cultured for 2 weeks on Murashige-Scoog (MS) media with Cd concentrations of 0, 400 and 600 microM, and on corresponding media supplied with Se (2 microM). Exposure to increasing Cd concentrations reduced the fresh weight of the upper part (hypocotyls+cotyledons) of the seedlings more strongly than that of the root system, which was accompanied by higher Cd accumulation in these tissues. In the upper part, Cd exposure led to significant changes in the biochemical parameters: fatty acid unsaturation of plasmalemma decreased, the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPOX) diminished and that of ascorbate peroxidase (APX) increased. In contrast, the roots showed an increase in fatty acid unsaturation and in the activity of antioxidative enzymes. In both parts of rape seedlings H(2)O(2) level and lipid peroxidation increased. Se addition to medium considerably reversed the Cd-induced decrease in fresh mass as well as the changes in lipid unsaturation and peroxidation. Se applied separately or in combination with Cd did not significantly affect the activity of antioxidative enzymes in the roots, but diminished it in the upper part. Moreover, the presence of Se in medium prevented changes in the DNA methylation pattern triggered in rape seedlings by high Cd concentrations. Two possible mechanisms for the action of Se were considered: (1) removal of Cd from metabolically active cellular sites, and (2) reduction of oxygen radicals.
17913526	Inhibition of iNOS expression and NO production by anti-inflammatory steroids. Reversal by histone deacetylase inhibitors.	In inflammation, nitric oxide (NO) is produced by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) induced by bacterial products and cytokines, and NO acts as a regulatory and pro-inflammatory mediator. Glucocorticoids are powerful anti-inflammatory agents that inhibit the expression of iNOS and various other inflammatory factors. Histone deacetylation has been recently described as a novel mechanism how glucocorticoids down-regulate transcriptional activation of some inflammatory genes. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of inhibitors of histone deacetylation on the suppressive effects of glucocorticoids on NO production and iNOS expression. Dexamethasone and a dissociated glucocorticoid RU24858 inhibited NO production, and iNOS protein and mRNA expression in macrophages exposed to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In the presence of a glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist mifepristone, dexamethasone and RU24858 had no effect on NO production. The role of histone deacetylation in the glucocorticoid effect was studied by using three structurally different inhibitors of histone deacetylases (HDACs): trichostatin A, apicidin and MC1293. HDAC inhibitors reversed the effects of dexamethasone and RU24858 on iNOS expression and NO production. Stably transfected A549/8 cells containing luciferase gene under the control of human iNOS promoter were used in promoter-activity studies. iNOS promoter activity induced by IL-1beta was inhibited by dexamethasone and the inhibitory effect was reversed by HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A. The results suggest that glucocorticoids inhibit iNOS expression and NO production by a GR-mediated and GRE-independent manner through histone deacetylation and transcriptional silencing.
17913699	Extensive contribution of embryonic stem cells to the development of an evolutionarily divergent host.	The full potential of embryonic stem (ES) cells to generate precise cell lineages and complex tissues can be best realized when they are differentiated in vivo-i.e. in developing blastocysts. Owing to various practical and ethical constraints, however, it is impossible to introduce ES cells of certain species into blastocysts of the same species. One solution is to introduce ES cells into blastocysts of a different species. However, it is not known whether ES cells can contribute extensively to chimerism when placed into blastocysts of a distantly related species. Here, we address this question using two divergent species, Apodemus sylvaticus and Mus musculus, whose genome sequence differs by approximately 18% from each other. Despite this considerable evolutionary distance, injection of Apodemus ES cells into Mus blastocysts led to viable chimeras bearing extensive Apodemus contributions to all major organs, including the germline, with Apodemus contribution reaching approximately 40% in some tissues. Immunostaining showed that Apodemus ES cells have differentiated into a wide range of cell types in the chimeras. Our results thus provide a proof of principle for the feasibility of differentiating ES cells into a wide range of cell types and perhaps even complex tissues by allowing them to develop in vivo in an evolutionarily divergent host-a strategy that may have important applications in research and therapy. Furthermore, our study demonstrates that mammalian evolution can proceed at two starkly contrasting levels: significant divergence in genome and proteome sequence, yet striking conservation in developmental programs.
17913739	NORINE: a database of nonribosomal peptides.	Norine is the first database entirely dedicated to nonribosomal peptides (NRPs). In bacteria and fungi, in addition to the traditional ribosomal proteic biosynthesis, an alternative ribosome-independent pathway called NRP synthesis allows peptide production. It is performed by huge protein complexes called nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). The molecules synthesized by NRPS contain a high proportion of nonproteogenic amino acids. The primary structure of these peptides is not always linear but often more complex and may contain cycles and branchings. In recent years, NRPs attracted a lot of attention because of their biological activities and pharmacological properties (antibiotic, immunosuppressor, antitumor, etc.). However, few computational resources and tools dedicated to those peptides have been available so far. Norine is focused on NRPs and contains more than 700 entries. The database is freely accessible at http://bioinfo.lifl.fr/norine/. It provides a complete computational tool for systematic study of NRPs in numerous species, and as such, should permit to obtain a better knowledge of these metabolic products and underlying biological mechanisms, and ultimately to contribute to the redesigning of natural products in order to obtain new bioactive compounds for drug discovery.
17913849	A web-based tool for in silico biomarker discovery based on tissue-specific protein profiles in normal and cancer tissues.	Here we report the development of a publicly available Web-based analysis tool for exploring proteins expressed in a tissue- or cancer-specific manner. The search queries are based on the human tissue profiles in normal and cancer cells in the Human Protein Atlas portal and rely on the individual annotation performed by pathologists of images representing immunohistochemically stained tissue sections. Approximately 1.8 million images representing more than 3000 antibodies directed toward human proteins were used in the study. The search tool allows for the systematic exploration of the protein atlas to discover potential protein biomarkers. Such biomarkers include tissue-specific markers, cell type-specific markers, tumor type-specific markers, markers of malignancy, and prognostic or predictive markers of cancers. Here we show examples of database queries to generate sets of candidate biomarker proteins for several of these different categories. Expression profiles of candidate proteins can then subsequently be validated by examination of the underlying high resolution images. The present study shows examples of search strategies revealing several potential protein biomarkers, including proteins specifically expressed in normal cells and in cancer cells from specified tumor types. The lists of candidate proteins can be used as a starting point for further validation in larger patient cohorts using both immunological approaches and technologies utilizing more classical proteomics tools.
17914064	Corticobasal syndrome and primary progressive aphasia as manifestations of LRRK2 gene mutations.	BACKGROUND: Mutations in the LRRK2 gene are an important cause of familial and nonfamilial parkinsonism. Despite pleomorphic pathology, LRRK2 mutations are believed to manifest clinically as typical Parkinson disease (PD). However, most genetic screens have been limited to PD clinic populations. OBJECTIVE: To clinically characterize LRRK2 mutations in cases recruited from a spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases. METHODS: We screened for the common G2019S mutation and several additional previously reported LRRK2 mutations in 434 individuals. A total of 254 patients recruited from neurodegenerative disease clinics and 180 neurodegenerative disease autopsy cases from the University of Pennsylvania brain bank were evaluated. RESULTS: Eight cases were found to harbor a LRRK2 mutation. Among patients with a mutation, two presented with cognitive deficits leading to clinical diagnoses of corticobasal syndrome and primary progressive aphasia. CONCLUSION: The clinical presentation of LRRK2-associated neurodegenerative disease may be more heterogeneous than previously assumed.
17914667	Does executive function matter for preschoolers' problem behaviors?	Early problem behaviors are associated with a variety of cognitive deficits: in verbal ability, executive function (EF) and theory of mind (ToM). Previous studies with different age-groups yield contrasting results: for 2-year-olds, ToM skills appear particularly salient (Hughes & Ensor, 2006), but for 4-year-olds EF appears more important (Hughes, White, Sharpen, & Dunn, 2000). To examine this apparent developmental change in the relative salience of cognitive deficits we followed 122 children from Hughes and Ensor's (2006) sample at ages 3 and 4. Tests of ToM, EF and verbal ability were included at each time-point and multi-informant, multi-measure, multi-setting ratings provided aggregate measures of problem behaviors. ToM and verbal ability showed non-specific associations with problem behaviors, but associations between EF and problem behaviors were strong and specific. In addition, age-3 EF mediated relations between age-2 verbal ability and age-4 problem behaviors.
17916350	Inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 participate in anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects of the natural marine compound lemnalol from Formosan soft coral Lemnalia cervicorni.	Lemnalol (8-isopropyl-5-methyl-4-methylene-decahydro-1,5-cyclo-naphthalen-3-ol) is a natural compound isolated from the marine soft coral Lemnalia cervicorni. In the present study, the anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive properties of lemnalol were investigated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells and carrageenan-injected rats, respectively. Our results demonstrate that lemnalol significantly inhibited the expression of the pro-inflammatory proteins, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. An in vivo inflammation model was induced by intraplantar injection of carrageenan into rat hind paws. An intramuscular injection of lemnalol (15 mg/kg) 10 min before carrageenan injection resulted in significant inhibition of carrageenan-induced rat paw edema and thermal hyperalgesia behavior. Western blot experiments revealed that the carrageenan-induced expression of iNOS and COX-2 in paw tissue was significantly down-regulated by lemnalol. Moreover, post-intrathecal injection of lemnalol produced a dose-dependent anti-nociceptive effect in carrageenan-injected rats (1 and 5 microg). The present results indicate that the marine-derived compound lemnalol had anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells and carrageenan-injected rats, respectively. In addition, inhibition of elevated iNOS and COX-2 protein expression as well as neurophil infiltration of carrageenan-injected paws may be involved in the beneficial effects of lemnalol.
17916570	PPT-DB: the protein property prediction and testing database.	The protein property prediction and testing database (PPT-DB) is a database housing nearly 30 carefully curated databases, each of which contains commonly predicted protein property information. These properties include both structural (i.e. secondary structure, contact order, disulfide pairing) and dynamic (i.e. order parameters, B-factors, folding rates) features that have been measured, derived or tabulated from a variety of sources. PPT-DB is designed to serve two purposes. First it is intended to serve as a centralized, up-to-date, freely downloadable and easily queried repository of predictable or 'derived' protein property data. In this role, PPT-DB can serve as a one-stop, fully standardized repository for developers to obtain the required training, testing and validation data needed for almost any kind of protein property prediction program they may wish to create. The second role that PPT-DB can play is as a tool for homology-based protein property prediction. Users may query PPT-DB with a sequence of interest and have a specific property predicted using a sequence similarity search against PPT-DB's extensive collection of proteins with known properties. PPT-DB exploits the well-known fact that protein structure and dynamic properties are highly conserved between homologous proteins. Predictions derived from PPT-DB's similarity searches are typically 85-95% correct (for categorical predictions, such as secondary structure) or exhibit correlations of >0.80 (for numeric predictions, such as accessible surface area). This performance is 10-20% better than what is typically obtained from standard 'ab initio' predictions. PPT-DB, its prediction utilities and all of its contents are available at http://www.pptdb.ca.
17916573	DB-PABP: a database of polyanion-binding proteins.	The interactions between polyanions (PAs) and polyanion-binding proteins (PABPs) have been found to play significant roles in many essential biological processes including intracellular organization, transport and protein folding. Furthermore, many neurodegenerative disease-related proteins are PABPs. Thus, a better understanding of PA/PABP interactions may not only enhance our understandings of biological systems but also provide new clues to these deadly diseases. The literature in this field is widely scattered, suggesting the need for a comprehensive and searchable database of PABPs. The DB-PABP is a comprehensive, manually curated and searchable database of experimentally characterized PABPs. It is freely available and can be accessed online at http://pabp.bcf.ku.edu/DB_PABP/. The DB-PABP was implemented as a MySQL relational database. An interactive web interface was created using Java Server Pages (JSP). The search page of the database is organized into a main search form and a section for utilities. The main search form enables custom searches via four menus: protein names, polyanion names, the source species of the proteins and the methods used to discover the interactions. Available utilities include a commonality matrix, a function of listing PABPs by the number of interacting polyanions and a string search for author surnames. The DB-PABP is maintained at the University of Kansas. We encourage users to provide feedback and submit new data and references.
17916583	Human angiogenin is a neuroprotective factor and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis associated angiogenin variants affect neurite extension/pathfinding and survival of motor neurons.	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a late onset neurodegenerative disorder affecting upper and lower motor neurons (MNs). The molecular mechanisms underlying ALS are poorly understood. Mutations in SOD1 is one of the known causes of ALS but occur only in a very small number of cases of ALS. Interestingly, mutations in human angiogenin (hANG), a member of the ribonuclease A (RNase A) superfamily known to be involved in neovascularization, have been recently reported in patients with ALS, but the effects of these mutations on MN differentiation and survival has not been investigated. We have used the well-characterized pluripotent P19 embryonal carcinoma (EC) cell culture model of neuro-ectodermal differentiation to study the effects of hANG-ALS variants on MN differentiation and survival. Here we report that P19 EC cells induced to differentiate in the presence of hANG and hANG-ALS-associated variants internalize the wild-type and variant proteins. The P19 EC cells differentiate to form neurons but the ability of the neurites to extend and make contacts with neighbouring neurites is compromised when treated with the hANG-ALS variants. In addition, hANG-ALS variants also have a cytotoxic effect on MNs leading to their degeneration. hANG was able to protect neurons from hypoxia-induced cell death, but the variants of hANG implicated in ALS lacked the neuroprotective activity. Our findings show that ANG plays an important role in neurite extension/pathfinding and survival providing a causal link between mutations in hANG and ALS.
17917720	Application of enriched stable isotopes as tracers in biological systems: a critical review.	The application of enriched stable isotopes of minerals and trace elements as tracers in biological systems is a rapidly growing research field that benefits from the many new developments in inorganic mass spectrometric instrumentation, primarily within inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) instrumentation, such as reaction/collision cell ICP-MS and multicollector ICP-MS with improved isotope ratio measurement and interference removal capabilities. Adaptation and refinement of radioisotope tracer experiment methodologies for enriched stable isotope experiments, and the development of new methodologies coupled with more advanced compartmental and mathematical models for the distribution of elements in living organisms has enabled a broader use of enriched stable isotope experiments in the biological sciences. This review discusses the current and future uses of enriched stable isotope experiments in biological systems.
17918232	Alpha-synuclein promoter haplotypes and dementia in Parkinson's disease.	Dementia is a common complication of Parkinson's disease (PD). It correlates significantly with the presence of cortical, limbic or nigral Lewy bodies, mainly constituted of alpha-synuclein. Mutations of the alpha-synuclein gene (SNCA) have been linked to rare familial forms of PD, while association studies on the promoter polymorphisms have given conflicting results in sporadic patients. We have performed a case control study to investigate whether genetic variability in the promoter of the alpha-synuclein gene could predispose to dementia in PD. A total of 114 demented patients and 114 non-demented patients with sporadic PD were included in the study. Six polymorphic loci (including the Rep1 microsatellite) in the promoter of the SNCA gene were examined. Each marker, taken individually, did not show association to dementia and no significant differences were observed in the inferred haplotype frequencies of demented and non-demented patients. Our data suggest the lack of involvement of the SNCA promoter in the pathogenesis of dementia in PD. Further studies in other populations are needed to confirm these results.
17918262	Metabolic syndrome traits in long-term survivors of pediatric sarcoma.	PURPOSE: The metabolic syndrome (MS), a cluster of central obesity, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, and hypertension, conveys an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. This cross-sectional study investigated the prevalence of metabolic syndrome traits (MST) in long-term survivors of pediatric sarcoma (SARC) who received multi-modality therapy (MMT). METHODS: Thirty-two SARC survivors (predominantly Ewings; median age 36.5; median age at MMT 15) underwent body composition, activity, and psychosocial analysis. Serum endocrine and inflammatory parameters and urine beta(2)-microglobulin (B2M) were evaluated. The prevalence of MST was compared to age- and gender-matched U.S. population data. RESULTS: SARC survivors were more likely to have two or more MST (OR 2.38 95% CI: [1.14, 5.04]). Analysis of individual MST demonstrated higher prevalence of hypertension (OR 2.61 95% CI: [1.20, 5.59]), hypertriglyceridemia (OR 3.63 95% CI: [1.75, 7.60]), and male visceral abdominal obesity (20-39 years old OR 4.63 95% CI: [0.91, 21.63], 40-59 years old OR infinity). Survivors 18-39 years old had a higher prevalence of the MS (OR 4.29 95% CI: [1.50, 11.21]), defined as three or more MST. Plasminogen activator inhibitory activity (P = 0.016) and B2M (P = 0.027) increased with increasing numbers of MST. In males, total testosterone declined (P = 0.0027) as the number of MST increased. Average (P = 0.014) and maximum (P = 0.021) activity levels decreased as the number of MST increased. CONCLUSION: After a median follow up of 17 years, adult SARC survivors of MMT had an increased prevalence of MST, especially those less than 40 years old. The development of MST in this population was associated with decreased testosterone and activity levels.
17919638	Alternating pressure air mattresses as prevention for pressure ulcers: a literature review.	OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this paper is to examine and synthesise the literature on alternating pressure air mattresses (APAMs) as a preventive measure for pressure ulcers. DESIGN: Literature review. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Cinahl, Central, Embase, and Medline databases were searched to identify original and relevant articles. Additional publications were retrieved from the references cited in the publications identified during the electronic database search. RESULTS: Thirty-five studies were included. Effectiveness and comfort of APAMs were the main focuses of the studies evaluating APAMs. Pressure ulcer incidence, contact interface pressure, and blood perfusion were the most frequently used outcome measures to evaluate the effectiveness of APAMs. Fifteen randomised controlled trials (RCTs) analysed the pressure ulcer incidence. One RCT compared a standard hospital mattress with an APAM and found that the APAM was a more effective preventive measure. RCTs comparing APAMs with constant-low-air mattresses resulted in conflicting evidence. There was also no clear evidence as to which type of APAM performed better. All RCTs had methodological flaws. The use of contact interface pressure and blood perfusion measurements to evaluate the effectiveness of APAMs is questionable. Comfort of APAMs was the primary outcome measure in only four studies. Different methods for assessment were used and different types of APAMs were evaluated. Better measures for comfort are needed. A few studies discussed technical problems associated with APAMs. Educating nurses in the correct use of APAMs is advisable. CONCLUSION: Taking into account the methodological issues, we can conclude that APAMs are likely to be more effective than standard hospital mattresses. Contact interface pressure and blood perfusion give only a hypothetical conclusion about APAMs' effectiveness. Additional large, high-quality RCTs are needed. No conclusions can be drawn regarding the comfort of APAMs. A number of technical problems associated with APAMs are related to nurses' improper use of the devices.
17919867	Experimental evaluation of rigor mortis IX. The influence of the breaking (mechanical solution) on the development of rigor mortis.	Objective measurements were carried out to study the possible re-establishment of rigor mortis on rats after "breaking" (mechanical solution). Our experiments showed that: *Cadaveric rigidity can re-establish after breaking. *A significant rigidity can reappear if the breaking occurs before the process is complete. *Rigidity will be considerably weaker after the breaking. *The time course of the intensity does not change in comparison to the controls: --the re-establishment begins immediately after the breaking; --maximal values are reached at the same time as in the controls; --the course of the resolution is the same as in the controls.
17919925	Power calculation for group fMRI studies accounting for arbitrary design and temporal autocorrelation.	When planning most scientific studies, one of the first steps is to carry out a power analysis to define a design and sample size that will result in a well-powered study. There are limited resources for calculating power for group fMRI studies due to the complexity of the model. Previous approaches for group fMRI power calculation simplify the study design and/or the variance structure in order to make the calculation possible. These approaches limit the designs that can be studied and may result in inaccurate power calculations. We introduce a flexible power calculation model that makes fewer simplifying assumptions, leading to a more accurate power analysis that can be used on a wide variety of study designs. Our power calculation model can be used to obtain region of interest (ROI) summaries of the mean parameters and variance parameters, which can be use to increase understanding of the data as well as calculate power for a future study. Our example illustrates that minimizing cost to achieve 80% power is not as simple as finding the smallest sample size capable of achieving 80% power, since smaller sample sizes require each subject to be scanned longer.
17919937	Tertiary climate change and the diversification of the Amazonian gecko genus Gonatodes (Sphaerodactylidae, Squamata).	The genus Gonatodes is a monophyletic group of small-bodied, diurnal geckos distributed across northern South America, Central America, and the Caribbean. We used fragments of three nuclear genes (RAG2, ACM4, and c-mos) and one mitochondrial gene (16S) to estimate phylogenetic relationships among Amazonian species of Gonatodes. We used Penalized Likelihood to estimate timing of diversification in the genus. Most cladogenesis occurred in the Oligocene and early Miocene and coincided with a burst of diversification in other South American animal groups including mollusks, birds, and mammals. The Oligocene and early Miocene were periods dominated by dramatic climate change and Andean orogeny and we suggest that these factors drove the burst of cladogenesis in Gonatodes geckos as well as other taxa. A common pattern in Amazonian taxa is a biogeographic split between the eastern and western Amazon basin. We observed two clades with this spatial distribution, although large differences in timing of divergence between the east-west taxon pairs indicate that these divergences were not the result of a common vicariant event.
17920052	Molecular prenatal diagnosis in 2 pregnancies at risk for spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita.	BACKGROUND: Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita (SEDC) is an autosomal dominant skeletal dysplasia characterized by short stature, abnormal epiphyses, and flattened vertebral bodies. Secondary prevention of SEDC can be achieved by prenatal diagnosis. Reports of antenatally-diagnosed SEDC fetuses have been very rare and molecular prenatal diagnosis even rarer. We previously reported a familial G504S mutation in the type II collagen (COL2A1) gene resulting in SEDC. In this study, molecular prenatal diagnosis was performed to 2 couples in this family with pregnancies at risk for SEDC. METHODS: Amniotic fluid was sampled by amniocentesis under ultrasound guidance at 19+3 and 18+6 weeks' gestation, respectively. Karyotype and molecular genetic analysis were performed on cultured amniotic fluid cells. Maternal cell contamination was excluded by short tandem repeat (STR) analysis. Direct DNA sequencing and DHPLC were conducted to detect the potential mutation in exon 23 of COL2A1 gene. Both women underwent serial sonograms because they insisted that the molecular diagnosis should be confirmed by another method, although they had been informed that mutation analysis is predictive of the disease. RESULTS: Karyotype of both fetuses was normal and molecular genetic analysis revealed that fetus 1 carried a G504S mutation in exon 23, while fetus 2 was normal. In case 1, femur length of the fetus was markedly below the 5th centile at 23 weeks' gestation, which confirms the accuracy of molecular diagnosis. A medical termination was carried out at 27+5 weeks' gestation and a male fetus with a relatively large head and short limbs was delivered. The fetal radiograph demonstrated a number of features, including generalised platyspondyly, absent ossification of the vertebral bodies in the cervical region and significant shortening of the long bones. The diagnosis of SEDC was thus confirmed clinically. Ultrasound monitoring of fetus 2 showed that its femur length was normal for gestational age at repeated scans, which was consistent with the molecular diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Molecular analysis allows early and accurate prenatal diagnosis for SEDC once mutation is known in a family. However, considering the poor genotype/phenotype correlation in many cases of SEDC, the combination of ultrasound as well as molecular genetic approach might be needed.
17920233	Combined treatment of P-gp-positive L1210/VCR cells by verapamil and all-trans retinoic acid induces down-regulation of P-glycoprotein expression and transport activity.	The development of the most common multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype associated with a massive overexpression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in neoplastic cells may result in more than one hundred fold higher resistance of these cells to several drugs. L1210/VCR is a P-gp-positive drug resistant cell line in which P-gp overexpression was achieved by repeated cultivation of parental cells with a stepwise increasing concentration of vincristine. Relatively little is known about regulation of P-gp expression. Therefore, serious efforts have been made to recognize all aspects involved in regulation of P-gp expression. Retinoic acid nuclear receptors are involved in regulating expression of a large number of different proteins. Several authors have described that all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA, ligand of retinoic acid receptors, RARs) may induce alterations in P-gp expression and/or activity in drug resistant malignant cell lines. There are also other nuclear receptors for retinoids--retinoid X receptors (RXRs)--that may be involved in the development of the P-gp-mediated MDR phenotype. The topic of the present paper is a study of the relationship, if any, between the regulatory pathways of nuclear receptors for retinoids and P-glycoprotein expression. Increased levels of mRNAs encoding the retinoic acid nuclear receptors RARalpha and gamma, as well as decreased levels of the mRNAs encoding RARbeta and the retinoid X receptor RXRgamma or slightly decreased levels of RXRbeta mRNA, were observed in L1210/VCR cells in comparison with parental L1210 cells. Neither L1210 cells nor L1210/VCR cells contained measurable amounts of mRNA encoding the RXRalpha receptor. ATRA did not influence the viability of L1210/VCR cells differently from L1210 cells. A combined treatment of L1210/VCR cells with vincristine (1.08 micromol/l) and ATRA induced slightly higher cell death than that observed with ATRA alone. When applied alone, ATRA did not influence P-gp expression (monitored by anti P-gp antibody c219 using western blot analysis) or transport activity (monitored by use of calcein/AM as a P-gp substrate by FACS) in L1210/VCR cells. In contrast, when ATRA was applied together with verapamil (an often used P-gp inhibitor), a significant decrease in P-gp expression and transport activity were observed. However, no significant differences in [11, 12-(3)H]-ATRA uptake were observed in either sensitive or resistant cells, in the latter case in the absence or presence of vincristine. Moreover, verapamil did not influence ATRA uptake under any conditions. Thus, we can conclude that the combined treatment of L1210/VCR cells with ATRA and verapamil is able to depress P-gp expression, and consequently its activity. ATRA is not a P-gp-transportable substance, and thus this effect could not be attributed to verapamil-induced inhibition of P-gp that would allow ATRA to reach retinoic acid nuclear receptors and activate them.
17920343	Sperm activation: role of reactive oxygen species and kinases.	Reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as the superoxide anion (O(2)(-*)), hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) and nitric oxide (NO*), when generated at low and controlled levels, act as second messengers. ROS regulate sperm capacitation, which is the complex series of changes allowing spermatozoa to bind to the zona pellucida surrounding the oocyte, induce the acrosome reaction (exocytotic event by which proteolytic enzymes are released) and fertilize the oocyte. Capacitating spermatozoa produce controlled amounts of ROS that regulate downstream events: first, the increase in cAMP, protein kinase A (PKA) activation and phosphorylation of PKA substrates (arginine-X-X-serine/threonine motif; 15-30 min); second, the phosphorylation of MEK (extracellular signal regulated kinase [ERK] kinase)-like proteins (30-60 min) and then that of the threonine-glutamate-tyrosine motif (>1 h); finally, the late tyrosine phosphorylation of fibrous sheath proteins (>2 h). Although all these events are ROS-dependent, the regulation by various kinases, protein kinase C, PKA, protein tyrosine kinases, the ERK pathway, etc. is different. ROS also regulate the acquisition of hyperactivated motility and the acrosome reaction by spermatozoa. ROS action is probably mediated via the sulfhydryl/disulfide pair on sperm proteins. Redundancy, cross talk, and multiple systems acting in parallel point to an array of safeguards assuring the timely function of spermatozoa.
17920563	Cinnamaldehyde suppresses toll-like receptor 4 activation mediated through the inhibition of receptor oligomerization.	Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a critical role in induction of innate immune and inflammatory responses by recognizing invading pathogens or non-microbial endogenous molecules. TLRs have two major downstream signaling pathways, MyD88- and TRIF-dependent pathways leading to the activation of NFkappaB and IRF3 and the expression of inflammatory mediators. Deregulation of TLR activation is known to be closely linked to the increased risk of many chronic diseases. Cinnamaldehyde (3-phenyl-2-propenal) has been reported to inhibit NFkappaB activation induced by pro-inflammatory stimuli and to exert anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial effects. However, the underlying mechanism has not been clearly identified. Our results showed that cinnamaldehyde suppressed the activation of NFkappaB and IRF3 induced by LPS, a TLR4 agonist, leading to the decreased expression of target genes such as COX-2 and IFNbeta in macrophages (RAW264.7). Cinnamaldehyde did not inhibit the activation of NFkappaB or IRF3 induced by MyD88-dependent (MyD88, IKKbeta) or TRIF-dependent (TRIF, TBK1) downstream signaling components. However, oligomerization of TLR4 induced by LPS was suppressed by cinnamaldehyde resulting in the downregulation of NFkappaB activation. Further, cinnamaldehyde inhibited ligand-independent NFkappaB activation induced by constitutively active TLR4 or wild-type TLR4. Our results demonstrated that the molecular target of cinnamaldehyde in TLR4 signaling is oligomerization process of receptor, but not downstream signaling molecules suggesting a novel mechanism for anti-inflammatory activity of cinnamaldehyde.
17920901	Influence of cell preparation and target location on the behavioral recovery after striatal transplantation of fetal dopaminergic neurons in a primate model of Parkinson's disease.	Surgeries involving transplantation of fetal dopamine (DA) neurons into the caudate-putamen of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) have been performed in various clinical trials to examine a potential restoration of motor function. The absence of studies in non-human primates to define the best transplantation protocols have lead to the use of a broad variety of techniques that potentially could have a major impact on the clinical outcome. The effects of using different cell and tissue preparation, and surgical targets, remain unknown. For this purpose, 20 St. Kitts African Green Monkeys (AFG) rendered parkinsonian by i.m. injection of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) were balanced into 4 groups and unilaterally grafted in the (a) caudate or (b) putamen with fetal ventral mesencephalic (VM) tissue as (c) solid pieces or as a (d) cell suspension. By 9 months post-transplantation all animals showed significant and similar behavioral improvement as determined by a UPDRS based PD scale. Postmortem analyses showed that VM transplants survived in all animals. They were located in both surgical target sites, producing a broad DA reinnervation of the targeted nuclei that could also extend to the non-grafted nucleus on the ipsilateral side. Although no differences between groups were found in survival of DA neurons or degree of DA reinnervation, there was a significant correlation between striatal reinnervation and behavioral recovery only in animals transplanted in the putamen surgical target. Additionally, there was in general a stronger glial reaction to solid grafts than to cell suspensions. These studies provide data for the optimal time course, cell preparation and surgical targets for systematic examinations of both potential benefits and side effects of dopamine neuron cell transplantation in primate models of PD.
17921189	Different mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent cytokine responses in cells of the monocyte lineage.	Macrophages release cytokines that may contribute to the chronic inflammation observed in pulmonary conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Thus, inhibition of macrophage cytokine production may have a therapeutic benefit. Human lung macrophages are a rich source of the proinflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-8, that are elevated in the bronchoalveolar lavage and sputum of subjects with respiratory diseases. Cytokine production from both monocytes and macrophages is mediated by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. This study compared the effects of a novel p38 MAPK inhibitor, N-cyano-N'-(2-{[8-(2,6-difluorophenyl)-4-(4-fluoro-2-methylphenyl)-7-oxo-7,8-dihydropyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-2-yl]amino}ethyl)-guanidine (PCG), and an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway inhibitor, 2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one (PD098059), on cytokine release from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated human monocytes, monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM), and lung macrophages. Lung macrophages, MDM, and monocytes were stimulated with LPS, and cytokine release was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Immunoblots were performed to confirm p38 and ERK1/2 MAPK expression and activity. PCG inhibited TNF-alpha release more effectively from monocytes compared with MDM or macrophages (maximal inhibition was 99.3 +/- 1.4, 62.7 +/- 4.3, and 58.6 +/- 6.6%, respectively; n = 7-9). PD098059 was less effective at suppressing TNF-alpha release from monocytes compared with MDM and lung macrophages (maximal inhibition was 37.4 +/- 2.8, 70.1 +/- 4.5, and 68.7 +/- 5.1%, respectively; n = 7-9). The pattern of GM-CSF, IL-6, and IL-8 release was comparable with that of TNF-alpha. These data suggest a differential involvement for each of these MAPK pathways in macrophage cytokine production compared with monocytes.
17921498	coliSNP database server mapping nsSNPs on protein structures.	We have developed coliSNP, a database server (http://yayoi.kansai.jaea.go.jp/colisnp) that maps non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) on the three-dimensional (3D) structure of proteins. Once a week, the SNP data from the dbSNP database and the protein structure data from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) are downloaded, and the correspondence of the two data sets is automatically tabulated in the coliSNP database. Given an amino acid sequence, protein name or PDB ID, the server will immediately provide known nsSNP information, including the amino acid mutation caused by the nsSNP, the solvent accessibility, the secondary structure and the flanking residues of the mutated residue in a single page. The position of the nsSNP within the amino acid sequence and on the 3D structure of the protein can also be observed. The database provides key information with which to judge whether an observed nsSNP critically affects protein function and/or stability. As far as we know, this is the only web-based nsSNP database that automatically compiles SNP and protein information in a concise manner.
17921510	Determination of natural radioactivity in drinking water in private dug wells in Akure, Southwestern Nigeria.	Gamma spectrometry of well water was done to measure the activity concentrations of gamma-emitters 226Ra and 228Ra from 238U and 232Th series, respectively, and 40K in their waters. Measurements were done using high-purity (HPGe) co-axial detectors (Canberra, GC 2018-7500 ) coupled to Canberra Multichannel Analyser system. Activity concentrations ranged from 0.57 to 26.86, 0.20 to 60.06 and 0.35 to 29.01 Bq l(-1) for 226Ra, 228Ra and 40K, respectively. Activity concentrations were compared with data from other parts of the world and used to estimate annual effective dose for three age groups. Total annual effective doses from the intake of these radionuclides in the waters ranged from 0.02 to 76.84, 0.02 to 38.80 and 0.05 to 481.60 mSv y(-1) for age group <1, 2-7 and > or =17 y, respectively. These values are considerably higher than both the World Health Organisation and the International Commission on Radiological Protection limits.
17921511	Radionuclide content and associated radiation hazards of building materials and by-products in Baoji, West China.	Seven types of common building materials and by-products of coal-fired power plants collected from Baoji, West China, were analysed for the natural radioactivity of 226Ra, 232Th and 40K using gamma ray spectrometry with an NaI(Tl) detector. The average activity concentrations vary from 23.0 to 112.2, 20.2 to 147.5 and 113.2 to 890.8 Bq kg(-1) for 226Ra, 232Th and 40K, respectively. The measured activity concentrations for these radionuclides were compared with the data reported from other countries and with the worldwide average activity of soil. As a measure of radiation hazard to the people, the radium equivalent activities, total annual effective dose and activity concentration index were estimated. The radium equivalent activities of the studied samples are below the internationally accepted values. The calculated total annual effective dose and the activity concentration index of seven types of common building materials are <1 mSv y(-1) and 1, respectively. But fly ash and bottom ash exhibit the higher values that exceed and be close to the acceptable values, respectively. This study shows that the measured building materials do not pose any significant source of radiation hazard and are safe for use in the construction of dwellings. Nevertheless, when fly ash and bottom ash are used in dwelling construction, it is important to assess their radiation potential.
17921517	Proteomics approach to identify dehydration responsive nuclear proteins from chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.).	Dehydration or water-deficit is one of the most important environmental stress factors that greatly influences plant growth and development and limits crop productivity. Plants respond and adapt to such stress by altering their cellular metabolism and activating various defense machineries. Mechanisms that operate signal perception, transduction, and downstream regulatory events provide valuable information about the underlying pathways involved in environmental stress responses. The nuclear proteins constitute a highly organized, complex network that plays diverse roles during cellular development and other physiological processes. To gain a better understanding of dehydration response in plants, we have developed a comparative nuclear proteome in a food legume, chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.). Three-week-old chickpea seedlings were subjected to progressive dehydration by withdrawing water and the changes in the nuclear proteome were examined using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Approximately 205 protein spots were found to be differentially regulated under dehydration. Mass spectrometry analysis allowed the identification of 147 differentially expressed proteins, presumably involved in a variety of functions including gene transcription and replication, molecular chaperones, cell signaling, and chromatin remodeling. The dehydration responsive nuclear proteome of chickpea revealed a coordinated response, which involves both the regulatory as well as the functional proteins. This study, for the first time, provides an insight into the complex metabolic network operating in the nucleus during dehydration.
17922027	The requirement for SNF5/INI1 in adipocyte differentiation highlights new features of malignant rhabdoid tumors.	ATP-dependent SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes regulate cell-cycle and play critical roles in a variety of differentiation pathways. The core subunit SNF5/INI1 is a tumor suppressor that is inactivated in a highly aggressive childhood cancer of unknown cellular origin, termed malignant rhabdoid tumor (MRT). The highly undifferentiated phenotype of this tumor suggests that the loss-of-function of hSNF5/INI1 impairs specific differentiation programs of the MRT parental cell. Based on the hypothesis that these programs might be reinitialized upon hSNF5/INI1 re-expression in MRTs, we show that some MRT cell lines can differentiate toward the adipogenic lineage. We further show that the knock down of the SNF5/INI1 subunit abrogates adipocyte differentiation of murine 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and of human mesenchymal stem cells. Finally, we provide evidence that hSNF5/INI1 cooperates with C/EBPbeta and PPARgamma2 transcriptional regulators to activate the expression of adipocyte-specific genes. These data indicate that not only the ATPase subunit of the SWI/SNF complex, but also SNF5/INI1 is required for adipocyte differentiation. They further show that MRT cell lines harbor an adipogenic differentiation potential and that the tumor suppressor role of the SNF5/INI1 subunit may rely on its ability to regulate the balance between cell proliferation and differentiation.
17922537	The diagnostic validity of the criteria for binge eating disorder.	OBJECTIVE: This paper considers whether the criteria currently used to classify the diagnosis of binge eating disorder (BED) are valid and appropriate. METHOD: We review evidence that reflects on the validity of the current criteria for binge eating episodes and BED, using literature retrieved through major psychology and psychiatry search engines (e.g., PsycInfo, PubMed). RESULTS: Evidence from experimental research points to the relative importance of episode frequency, the amount of food consumed at episodes, the subjective sense of loss of control over eating, and several additional criteria associated with binge episodes in BED. Evidence on the differences in psychopathology between BED and bulimia nervosa and between BED and obesity without binge eating, as related to diagnostic criteria, is reviewed. CONCLUSION: Although evidence concerning the diagnostic criteria of BED is mixed, broadening certain diagnostic criteria for binge eating episodes and BED might more accurately reflect the research literature and increase the number of individuals eligible for inclusion in treatment programs.
17924089	[Malignant neuroleptic syndrome associated with amisulpride].	Malignant neuroleptic syndrome (MNS) is a rare side effect of antipsychotic medications but means a serious and life-threatening complication. The risk of MNS seems to be lower for second generation antipsychotics (SGA). We report the 9-month history of a 42-year-old female patient whose antipsychotic medication was switched to 800 mg per day of amisulpride. Two weeks after discharge she suffered muscular pain, stiffness, weakness of the legs, rigor, and fever. After attending our outpatient department and being diagnosed, she was transferred to the neurological intensive unit, where the creatine kinase (CK) level was measured at 160,000 U/l. Furthermore extensive rhabdomyolysis accompanied by a compartment syndrome was seen. Surgical intervention was necessary for the latter. The patient was then retransferred to the psychiatric department after treatment with lorazepam and withdrawal of antipsychotic medications. In addition a therapy with valproate sodium was conducted. Long-term high levels of CK and abnormalities in the electromyogram led to the hypothesis of myopathy as a possible risk factor, but a final diagnostic classification was not feasible. This report describes the appearance of a MNS as a consequence of SGA therapy, discusses risk factors and therapy options, and shows the 9-month course.
17924158	Population dynamics and diversity of viruses, bacteria and phytoplankton in a shallow eutrophic lake.	We have studied the temporal variation in viral abundances and community assemblage in the eutrophic Lake Loosdrecht through epifluorescence microscopy and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The virioplankton community was a dynamic component of the aquatic community, with abundances ranging between 5.5 x 10(7) and 1.3 x 10(8) virus-like particles ml(-1) and viral genome sizes ranging between 30 and 200 kb. Both viral abundances and community composition followed a distinct seasonal cycle, with high viral abundances observed during spring and summer. Due to the selective and parasitic nature of viral infection, it was expected that viral and host community dynamics would covary both in abundances and community composition. The temporal dynamics of the bacterial and cyanobacterial communities, as potential viral hosts, were studied in addition to a range of environmental parameters to relate these to viral community dynamics. Cyanobacterial and bacterial communities were studied applying epifluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Both bacterial and cyanobacterial communities followed a clear seasonal cycle. Contrary to expectations, viral abundances were neither correlated to abundances of the most dominant plankton groups in Lake Loosdrecht, the bacteria and the filamentous cyanobacteria, nor could we detect a correlation between the assemblage of viral and bacterial or cyanobacterial communities during the overall period. Only during short periods of strong fluctuations in microbial communities could we detect viral community assemblages to covary with cyanobacterial and bacterial communities. Methods with a higher specificity and resolution are probably needed to detect the more subtle virus-host interactions. Viral abundances did however relate to cyanobacterial community assemblage and showed a significant positive correlation to Chl-a as well as prochlorophytes, suggesting that a significant proportion of the viruses in Lake Loosdrecht may be phytoplankton and more specific cyanobacterial viruses. Temporal changes in bacterial abundances were significantly related to viral community assemblage, and vice versa, suggesting an interaction between viral and bacterial communities in Lake Loosdrecht.
17924536	5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)-amiloride enhances SMN2 exon 7 inclusion and protein expression in spinal muscular atrophy cells.	OBJECTIVE: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a common inherited neuromuscular disorder caused by homozygous loss of function of the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene. All SMA patients carry at least one copy of a nearly identical SMN2 gene. However, a critical nucleotide change in SMN2 results in alternative splicing and exclusion of exon 7 in the majority of SMN2 messenger RNA (mRNA), thus producing a low level of functional SMN protein. Increasing SMN protein production by promoting SMN2 exon 7 inclusion could be a therapeutic approach for SMA. It has been shown that cellular pH microenvironment can modulate pre-mRNA alternative splicing in vivo. In this study, we tested whether inhibitors of the Na+/H+ exchanger can modulate the exon 7 splicing of SMN2 mRNA METHODS: We treated SMA lymphoid cell lines with Na+/H+ exchanger inhibitors and then measured SMN2 exon 7 splicing by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and SMN protein production by Western blotting and immunofluorescence RESULTS: We found that treatment with an Na+/H+ exchanger inhibitor, 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)-amiloride (EIPA), significantly enhances SMN2 exon 7 inclusion and SMN protein production in SMA cells. In addition, EIPA increases the number of nuclear gems in SMA cells. We further explored the underlying mechanism, and our results suggest that EIPA may promote SMN2 exon 7 inclusion through upregulation of the splicing factor SRp20 in the nucleus INTERPRETATION: Our finding that EIPA, an inhibitor of the Na+/H+ exchanger, can increase SMN protein expression in SMA cells provides a new direction for the development of drugs for SMA treatment. However, further translational studies are needed to determine whether this finding is applicable for SMA treatment or just a proof of cellular pH effect on SMN splicing.
17925420	Power spectral analysis of EEG activity during sleep in cigarette smokers.	BACKGROUND: Research on the effects of cigarette smoking on sleep architecture is limited. The objective of this investigation was to examine differences in sleep EEG between smokers and nonsmokers. METHODS: Smokers and nonsmokers who were free of all medical comorbidities were matched on different factors, including age, gender, race, body mass index, and anthropometric measures. Home polysomnography was conducted using a standard recording montage. Sleep architecture was assessed using visual sleep-stage scoring. The discrete fast Fourier transform was used to calculate the EEG power spectrum for the entire night within contiguous 30-s epochs of sleep for the following frequency bandwidths: delta (0.8 to 4.0 Hz); theta (4.1 to 8.0 Hz); alpha (8.1 to 13.0 Hz); and beta (13.1 to 20.0 Hz). RESULTS: Conventional sleep stages were similar between the two groups. However, spectral analysis of the sleep EEG showed that, compared to nonsmokers, smokers had a lower percentage of EEG power in the delta-bandwidth (59.7% vs 62.6%, respectively; p < 0.04) and higher percentage of EEG power in alpha-bandwidth (15.6% vs 12.5%, respectively; p < 0.001). Differences in the EEG power spectrum between smokers and nonsmokers were greatest in the early part of the sleep period and decreased toward the end. Subjective complaints of lack of restful sleep were also more prevalent in smokers than in nonsmokers (22.5% vs 5.0%, respectively; p < 0.02) and were explained, in part, by the differences in EEG spectral power. CONCLUSIONS: Cigarette smokers manifest disturbances in the sleep EEG that are not evident in conventional measures of sleep architecture. Nicotine in cigarette smoke and withdrawal from it during sleep may contribute to these changes and the subjective experience of nonrestorative sleep.
17926153	Treatment of experimental verapamil poisoning with levosimendan utilizing a rodent model of drug toxicity.	BACKGROUND: Levosimendan is an inotropic agent used in the treatment of heart failure. It is a myocardial calcium sensitizer, binding to cardiac troponin-C, and a vascular K+ATP-channel agonist producing peripheral vasodilatation. AIMS: To assess the effect of levosimendan on cardiac output (CO), blood pressure (BP), and heart rate (HR) in a rodent model of severe verapamil poisoning. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were anesthetized, ventilated, and canulated with jugular and femoral venous catheters and a femoral arterial catheter. CO, systolic BP, MAP, and HR were recorded. Verapamil was infused at 6 mg/kg/h until MAP dropped to 50% of baseline (time-0) and then reduced to 4 mg/kg/h. There were five treatment groups (n = 7 per group): 1) normal saline infusion (control); 2) CaCl2 loading dose and infusion (CaCl2); 3) levosimendan 24 microgram/kg loading dose and 0.6 microgram/kg/min infusion (Levo-24); 4) levosimendan 6 microgram/kg loading dose and 0.4 microgram/kg/min infusion (Levo-6); and 5) levosimendan 0.4 microgram/kg/min infusion with concurrent CaCl2 loading dose and infusion (Levo + CaCl2). Hemodynamic parameters were recorded for 70 minutes. Primary outcome measures were changes observed in CO, BP, and HR with treatments compared to control. Secondary outcome measure was survival. Results were analyzed using one-way ANOVA with Dunnet's post-test comparison with the control group. RESULTS: All groups had similar BP, HR, and CO at base line and peak toxicity. The control group's HR, BP, and CO progressively fell during the verapamil infusion. Levo-24, Levo + CaCl2, and CaCl2 maintained CO compared with control from t = 20 min and Levo6 from t = 30 min (p < 0.05). CaCl2 (from t = 10 min) and Levo + CaCl2 (from t = 20 min) produced significant improvements in BP compared to control. However, BP did not return to pre-toxicity levels. Levo-6 and Levo-24 groups did not recover from the hypotension seen at pre-treatment maximal toxicity. HR was maintained in all treatment groups compared to control animals. Twenty-nine percent (2/7) of control, 86% (6/7) levosimendan, 100% (7/7) CaCl2, and Levo + CaCl2 animals survived to the end of the protocol. CONCLUSIONS: Levosimendan increased CO in this model of verapamil poisoning to a similar degree as CaCl2 alone, but it did not improve BP from time of maximal toxicity. The addition of CaCl2 to Levosimendan did not appear to result in any further improvement in CO and BP compared to CaCl2 alone. The failure of levosimendan to improve BP may result from vasodilation induced by levosimendan peripheral vascular K+ATP-channel agonism. This may compound the vasodilatory effects of verapamil and offset any hemodynamic improvements produced by increased cardiac output.
17927562	Mammalian GPI-anchored proteins require p24 proteins for their efficient transport from the ER to the plasma membrane.	The GPI (glycosylphosphatidylinositol) moiety is attached to newly synthesized proteins in the lumen of the ER (endoplasmic reticulum). The modified proteins are then directed to the PM (plasma membrane). Less well understood is how nascent mammalian GPI-anchored proteins are targeted from the ER to the PM. In the present study, we investigated mechanisms underlying membrane trafficking of the GPI-anchored proteins, focusing on the early secretory pathway. We first established a cell line that stably expresses inducible temperature-sensitive GPI-fused proteins as a reporter and examined roles of transport-vesicle constituents called p24 proteins in the traffic of the GPI-anchored proteins. We selectively suppressed one of the p24 proteins, namely p23, employing RNAi (RNA interference) techniques. The suppression resulted in pronounced delays of PM expression of the GPI-fused reporter proteins. Furthermore, maturation of DAF (decay-accelerating factor), one of the GPI-anchored proteins in mammals, was slowed by the suppression of p23, indicating delayed trafficking of DAF from the ER to the Golgi. Trafficking of non-GPI-linked cargo proteins was barely affected by p23 knockdown. This is the first to demonstrate direct evidence for the transport of mammalian GPI-anchored proteins being mediated by p24 proteins.
17927771	A checklist for ecological management of landscapes for conservation.	The management of landscapes for biological conservation and ecologically sustainable natural resource use are crucial global issues. Research for over two decades has resulted in a large literature, yet there is little consensus on the applicability or even the existence of general principles or broad considerations that could guide landscape conservation. We assess six major themes in the ecology and conservation of landscapes. We identify 13 important issues that need to be considered in developing approaches to landscape conservation. They include recognizing the importance of landscape mosaics (including the integration of terrestrial and aquatic areas), recognizing interactions between vegetation cover and vegetation configuration, using an appropriate landscape conceptual model, maintaining the capacity to recover from disturbance and managing landscapes in an adaptive framework. These considerations are influenced by landscape context, species assemblages and management goals and do not translate directly into on-the-ground management guidelines but they should be recognized by researchers and resource managers when developing guidelines for specific cases. Two crucial overarching issues are: (i) a clearly articulated vision for landscape conservation and (ii) quantifiable objectives that offer unambiguous signposts for measuring progress.
17928086	The selection pressure analysis of classical swine fever virus envelope protein genes Erns and E2.	Classical swine fever virus, one member of the family Flaviviridae, is the pathogen of CSF, an economically important and highly contagious disease of pigs. Knowledge of virus genes under positive selection pressure can help identify molecular determinants of virulence or pathogenesis without prior knowledge of the mechanisms governing virulence and pathogenesis and clarify the driving force of classical swine fever virus evolution. The positive selection pressure acting on envelope protein genes E(rns), E1 and E2 of classical swine fever virus were assessed and a site-by-site analysis of the d(N)/d(S) ratio was performed, to identify specific codons undergoing diversifying positive selection. Whilst no significant evidence for positive selection was observed in E1, four positively selected sites (208 in E(rns) and 72, 75, and 200 in E2) were identified. The positively selected site (208) of E(rns) corresponds to one of the amino acid substitutions (Ser to Arg) found in an HS-binding CSFV variant. The mutant at the positively selected site (75) is located within an O-glycosylation motif and altered the predicted glycosylation pattern. In addition, Thr at the positively selective site 200 are directly involved with mAb WH308 with which CS vaccine strain does not react, unlike most of the virulent CSFV strains.
17928113	Shear stress and vascular smooth muscle cells promote endothelial differentiation of endothelial progenitor cells via activation of Akt.	BACKGROUND: The structural and functional integrity of endothelium plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) is a population of pluripotent cells, which have a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of endothelium, but the mechanisms regulating the differentiation of EPCs have not been understood completely. In this study, the effects of shear stress and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) on the differentiation of EPCs, as well as the role of Akt were examined in a coculture model. METHODS: Human EPCs separated from cord blood were subjected to shear stress by using a parallel-plate coculture flow chamber. The expression of CD133, CD34, CD31 and von Willebrand factor of EPCs were assessed by a flow cytometry. Activation of Akt was detected by Western blot. FINDINGS: Both shear stress and VSMCs increase the expression of endothelial markers, CD31 and von Willebrand factor (vWF), simultaneously, decrease progenitor markers, CD133 and CD34, of EPCs. However, the effect of shear stress on EPC differentiation was much more significant when VMSCs were presented. Akt was activated in EPCs by shear stress, VSMCs or both. When the activation of Akt was blocked with its inhibitor during EPCs exposed to shear stress, CD133 and CD34 expressions were upregulated and correspondingly CD31 and vWF expressions were downregulated significantly. INTERPRETATIONS: The results demonstrate that shear stress and VSMCs promote endothelial differentiation of EPCs via activation of Akt, which provide a new insight to clinical application on the regeneration of the vascular endothelium.
17928127	Regulation of macroautophagy by mTOR and Beclin 1 complexes.	Macroautophagy or autophagy is a vacuolar degradative pathway terminating in the lysosomal compartment after forming a cytoplasmic vacuole or autophagosome that engulfs macromolecules and organelles. The original discovery that ATG (AuTophaGy related) genes in yeast are involved in the formation of autophagosomes has greatly increased our knowledge of the molecular basis of autophagy, and its role in cell function that extends far beyond non-selective degradation. The regulation of autophagy by signaling pathways overlaps the control of cell growth, proliferation, cell survival and death. The evolutionarily conserved TOR (Target of Rapamycin) kinase complex 1 plays an important role upstream of the Atg1 complex in the control of autophagy by growth factors, nutrients, calcium signaling and in response to stress situations, including hypoxia, oxidative stress and low energy. The Beclin 1 (Atg6) complex, which is involved in the initial step of autophagosome formation, is directly targeted by signaling pathways. Taken together, these data suggest that multiple signaling checkpoints are involved in regulating autophagosome formation.
17928166	The incremental inpatient costs associated with marijuana comorbidity.	In this paper we examine the incremental cost of marijuana comorbidity for alcohol, mood and thought diagnoses in hospital settings. We use data from the 1993-2000 National Hospital Discharge Survey to examine the effect on length of stay and the 1995-2000 Florida Hospital Discharge Data to examine charges. General linear modeling (GLM) and propensity score methods are employed to deal with concerns stemming from the distribution of the dependent variables and statistically significant differences in the baseline characteristics of marijuana users versus non-users. Marijuana comorbidity is associated with longer length of stays and higher charges for patients suffering from a primary diagnosis of an alcohol problem. We also find higher average charges for patients suffering from mood disorders, though the finding is not robust across all model specifications. We do not find any significant effects for thought disorders. Findings from this study suggest that a marijuana comorbidity increases the cost of treating patients with alcohol problems and mood disorder diagnoses, implying that there may be real health consequences associated with marijuana abuse and dependence and more work considering this possibility is warranted.
17928235	Focal adhesion kinase as a regulator of cell tension in the progression of cancer.	Growing evidence indicates that critical steps in cancer progression such as cell adhesion, migration, and cell cycle progression are regulated by the composition and organization of the microenvironment. The adhesion of cancer cells to components of the microenvironment and the forces transmitted to the cells via the actinomyosin network and the signaling complexes organized within focal adhesions allow cancer cells to sense the local topography of the extracellular matrix and respond efficiently to proximal growth and migration promoting cues. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase that is over expressed in a variety of cancers and plays an important role in cell adhesion, migration, and anchorage-dependent growth. In this review, we summarize evidence which implicate FAK in the ability of cells to sense and respond to local forces from the microenvironment through the regulation of adhesion dynamics and actinomyosin contractility, and we discuss the potential roles of FAK as a mechanosensor in the progression of cancer.
17928366	MEK1 and MEK2 regulate distinct functions by sorting ERK2 to different intracellular compartments.	In this study, we provide novel insight into the mechanism of how ERK2 can be sorted to different intracellular compartments and thereby mediate different responses. MEK1-activated ERK2 accumulated in the nucleus and induced proliferation. Conversely, MEK2-activated ERK2 was retained in the cytoplasm and allowed survival. Localization was a determinant for ERK2 functions since MEK1 switched from providing proliferation to be a mediator of survival when ERK2 was routed to the cytoplasm by the attachment of a nuclear export site. MEK1-mediated ERK2 nuclear translocation and proliferation were shown to depend on phosphorylation of S298 and T292 sites in the MEK1 proline-rich domain. These sites are phosphorylated on cellular adhesion in MEK1 but not MEK2. Whereas p21-activated kinase phosphorylates S298 and thus enhances the MEK1-ERK2 association, ERK2 phosphorylates T292, leading to release of active ERK2 from MEK1. On the basis of these results, we propose that the requirement of adhesion for cells to proliferate in response to growth factors, in part, may be explained by the MEK1 S298/T292 control of ERK2 nuclear translocation. In addition, we suggest that ERK2 intracellular localization determines whether growth factors mediate proliferation or survival and that the sorting occurs in an adhesion-dependent manner.
17928529	The ubiquitin-mediated degradation of Jak1 modulates osteoclastogenesis by limiting interferon-beta-induced inhibitory signaling.	Interferons (IFNs) have been shown to negatively regulate osteoclastogenesis. In a proteomic study to assess protein expression during osteoclastogenesis, we discovered that the expression level of Jak1 was significantly decreased during the early stage of osteoclast differentiation from mouse bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) upon stimulation with receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB ligand (RANKL). RANKL induced Jak1 ubiquitination, and a proteasome inhibitor MG132 efficiently blocked the RANKL-induced degradation of Jak1. The expression level of Jak1 correlated with the susceptibility of osteoclast precursors to the negative regulatory effects of IFN-beta on osteoclastogenesis, since preosteoclasts (pOCs) in which Jak1 expression is significantly reduced could proceed with osteoclastogenesis in the presence of IFN-beta. Forced down-regulation of Jak1 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) resulted in the efficient osteoclast differentiation of BMMs in the presence of inhibitory IFN-beta, while overexpression of Jak1 in pOCs elicited IFN-beta-dependent inhibition of osteoclastogenesis. Furthermore, we found that the IFN-beta-induced inhibition of osteoclastogenesis required STAT3 downstream of Jak1. These data suggest that the regulation of Jak1 expression during osteoclast differentiation might serve as an intrinsic mechanism that determines osteoclast lineage commitment by modulating the negative regulation by IFN-beta.
17928805	Twelve-year trends and correlates of dietary salt intakes for the general adult population of Geneva, Switzerland.	BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Investigate dietary salt intake trends by gender, and their associations with risk factors for cardiovascular diseases in Geneva, Switzerland. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Continuous surveillance of the Geneva general adult (35-74 years) population for 12 years (1993-2004) using a validated, semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) in random, cross-sectional, representative samples (6688 men, 6647 women). Dietary salt intake assessment by FFQ excluded discretionary salt, but was calibrated on total salt intake using an independent validation substudy of 100 volunteers who additionally provided 24-h urine collections. RESULTS: Quartiles (mean) of calibrated dietary salt intake (g per day) were 9.9, 10.5, 11.2 (10.6) in men, and 7.0, 7.8, 8.9 (8.1) in women and were above current recommendations. Quartiles (mean) of salt density (g MJ(-1)) were 0.99, 1.16, 1.39 (1.23) in men, and 0.98, 1.12, 1.30 (1.17) in women. Both measures were stable during the 12-year surveillance period, regardless of hypertension treatment. Salt-density differences between cardiovascular disease risk factor subgroups were moderate. Salt density increased with age and body mass index. The main dietary non-discretionary salt food sources (men/women: 47/48%) were breads (17/17%), cheeses (11/10%), meat and meat products (8/7%), soups (6/9%) and ready-to-eat foods (5/5%). CONCLUSIONS: Salt intakes from all sources for the Geneva, and perhaps the Swiss adult population are above current recommendations. The quantitative and qualitative data provided in this paper could be used to develop and implement strategies for salt-intake reduction in Switzerland.
17929009	Ligand-escape pathways from the ligand-binding domain of PPARgamma receptor as probed by molecular dynamics simulations.	Conformational rearrangements of peroxysome proliferator activated receptor (PPARgamma) ligand-binding domain (LBD) that accompany the release and binding of ligands are not well understood. To determine the major events associated with the escape of the partial agonist GW0072, molecular dynamic (MD) simulations were performed using two different methods: reversed targeted molecular dynamics (TMD(-1)) and time-dependent distance restraints (TDR) using as restraints either the root mean square deviation from a reference structure (TMD(-1)) or the distance between the geometrical centers of the binding pocket and of the ligand (TDR). Both methods do not assume any a priori route for ligand extraction. To avoid artifacts, different initial simulation conditions were used and particular attention was paid for giving time to the protein to relax during the extraction process by running 10-12 ns simulations within explicit water. Two distinct exit gates A and B were found, independently of initial conditions and method. During the exit process no interaction between GW0072 and the transactivation AF-2 helix was observed. Our results suggest that the ligand uses the intrinsic flexibility of the protein to move within the receptor. Paths A and B are very similar to those found for other nuclear receptors, suggesting that these routes are a common characteristics of nuclear receptors that are used by different kinds of ligands. Finally, the knowledge of entry/exit pathways of a receptor should be very useful in discriminating between different ligands that could have been favorably docked in the binding pocket by introducing docking along these pathways into computational drug design protocols.
17929165	Histologic grading is an independent prognostic factor in invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast.	UNLABELLED: Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) comprises approximately 5-15% of breast cancers and appears to have a distinct biology. As it is less common than invasive ductal carcinoma, few studies of large size have addressed the value of assessment of histologic grade in ILC. METHODS: This study is based on a large and well-characterised consecutive series of breast cancer (4,987 cases), from a single institution, with a long-term follow-up to assess the prognostic value of routine assessment of histologic grade in ILC. Histologic grade and other clinicopathological data were available in 517 pure ILC cases. A panel of biomarkers was also available for 215 cases. RESULTS: The majority of ILC was of classical and mixed lobular variants (89%). Most ILC cases were moderately differentiated (grade 2) tumours (76%), while a small proportion of tumours were either grade 1 or 3 tumours (12% each). There were positive associations between histologic grade and other clinicopathological variables of poor prognosis such as larger size, positive lymph node, vascular invasion, oestrogen receptor and androgen receptor negativity and p53 positivity. Multivariate analyses showed that histologic grade is an independent predictor of shorter breast cancer specific survival and disease free interval. CONCLUSION: Histologic grade of ILC, as assessed by the Nottingham grading system, provides a strong predictor of outcome in patients with invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast and should be provided routinely in pathology reports.
17929168	Nigella sativa and derived thymoquinone prevents hippocampal neurodegeneration after chronic toluene exposure in rats.	The aim of this study was designed to investigate the possible beneficial effects of Nigella sativa (NS) and derived thymoquinone (TQ) on neurodegeneration in hippocampus after chronic toluene exposure in rats. The rats were randomly allotted into one of four experimental groups: A (control), B (toluene treated), C (toluene treated with NS) and D (toluene treated with TQ); each group contain 10 animals. Toluene treatment was performed by inhalation of 3,000 ppm toluene, in a 8 h/day and 6 day/week order for 12 weeks. Control group received 1 ml serum physiologic and the rats in NS and TQ treated groups (C and D) were given NS (in a dose of 400 mg/kg body weight) and TQ (50 mg/kg body weight) once a day orally by using intra gastric intubation for 12 weeks starting just after toluene exposure respectively. Tissue samples were obtained for histopathological investigation. To date, no histopathological changes of neurodegeneration in hippocampus after chronic toluene exposure in rats by NS and TQ treatment have been reported. In this study, chronic toluene exposure caused severe degenerative changes, shrunken cytoplasma, slightly dilated cisternae of endoplasmic reticulum, markedly swollen mitochondria with degenerated cristae and nuclear membrane breakdown with chromatin disorganization in neurons of the hippocampus. The distorted nerve cells were mainly absent in the TQ and NS-treated rats. We conclude that TQ and especially NS therapy causes morphologic improvement on neurodegeneration in hippocampus after chronic toluene exposure in rats. We believe that further preclinical research into the utility of NS and TQ may indicate its usefulness as a potential treatment on neurodegeneration after chronic toluene exposure in rats.
17929195	Molecular cloning and characterization of an inducible RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene, GhRdRP, from cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.).	The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) cDNA, designated as Gossypium hirsutum RdRP (GhRdRP) was cloned from cotton by rapid amplification of cDNA ends-polymerase chain reaction (RACE-PCR). The full-length cDNA was 3,672 bp in size and encoded an open reading frame (ORF) of 1,110 amino acids which contained the RdRP conserved functional domain and the signature motif DbDGD. Amino acid sequence alignment indicated that GhRdRP shared the highest identity (66.37%) with AtRdRP1 and had homology with other plant, fungal, yeast and nematode RdRPs. The corresponding genomic DNA containing five exons and four introns, was isolated and analyzed. Also a 5'-flanking region was cloned, and a group of putative cis-acting elements were identified. Southern blot analysis revealed a single copy of the GhRdRP gene in cotton genome. The expression analysis by semi-quantitative RT-PCR showed that GhRdRP was induced by salicylic acid (SA), 5-chloroSA (5-CSA) and fungal infection of Rhizoctonia solani Kuhn. The cloning and characterization of the GhRdRP gene will be useful for further studies of biological roles of GhRdRP in plants.
17929247	Docosahexaenoic acid is more potent inhibitor of osteoclast differentiation in RAW 264.7 cells than eicosapentaenoic acid.	Fish oil rich in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) protects inflammation induced bone loss in chronic inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, periodontitis, and osteoporosis. EPA and DHA differentially regulate functional parameters and gene expression in different cell types. One of the risk factors for bone loss in inflammatory bone diseases is the elevation of bone-resorbing osteoclasts and a very few studies so far have indicated that attenuation of osteoclastogenesis might be one of the mechanisms by which n-3 PUFA exert its effect on bone loss protection. However, the precise mechanism underlying this process remains unclear. Receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL) is known to be the most critical mediator of osteoclastogenesis. Therefore, in this study, we examined the differential effect of EPA and DHA on RANKL-stimulated osteoclastogenesis and RANKL signaling using a murine monocytic cell line RAW 264.7. DHA was found to inhibit osteoclast differentiation, activation and function more potently than EPA. The differential potential also closely correlated with the inhibition of osteoclast-specific genes like tartrate resistant acid phosphatase, cathepsin K, calcitonin receptor, matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression and osteoclast-specific transcription factor, c-Fos, as well as osteotropic proinflammatory cytokine, TNF-alpha to a greater extent with DHA than EPA. Further, pretreatment of RAW 264.7 cells with DHA also showed significantly reduced activation of NF-kappaB and p38MAPK than EPA. Our findings suggest that DHA may be much more effective than EPA in alleviating RANKL induced proinflammatory cytokine production, intracellular signaling activation, thereby decreasing osteoclast activation and bone resorption.
17929330	Design and analysis of structure-activity relationship of novel antimicrobial peptides derived from the conserved sequence of cecropin.	We have de novo designed four antimicrobial peptides AMP-A/B/C/D, the 51-residues peptides, which are based on the conserved sequence of cecropin. In the present study, the four peptides were chemically synthesized and their activities assayed. Their secondary structure, amphipathic property, electric field distribution and transmembrane domain were subsequently predicted by bioinformatics tools. Finally, the structure-activity relationship was analyzed from the results of activity experiments and prediction. The results of activity experiments indicated that AMP-B/C/D clearly possessed excellent broad-spectrum activity against bacteria, whereas AMP-A was almost inactive against most of the bacterial strains tested. AMP-B/C/D showed more potent activity against Gram-positive bacteria than against Gram-negative bacteria. By utilizing bioinformatics analysis tools, we found that the secondary structure of the four cation peptides was mainly alpha-helix, and the result of CD spectrum also displayed that all the peptides had considerable alpha-helix in the presence of either 50% TFE or SDS micelles. AMP-C showed much better activity than other peptides against most of the bacteria tested, owing to its remarkable cation property and the amphipathic character of its N-terminal. The study of structure-activity relationship of the designed peptides confirmed that amphipathic structure and high net positive charge were prerequisites for maintaining their activities.
17931766	Attachment, aggression and affiliation: the role of oxytocin in female social behavior.	The peptide hormones oxytocin and vasopressin have been implicated in a range of mammalian social behaviors including maternal care, pair bonding and affiliation. Oxytocin is of special relevance to female behavior because its effects are strongly modulated by estrogen. This article reviews animal and human research and is organised in terms of two research perspectives. The specific attachment model identifies oxytocin as orchestrating special bonds with offspring and mates, including the use of aggression in the protection of these relationships. The trait affiliation model considers oxytocin in relation to the trait of general social motivation that varies between and within species. Implications for understanding and researching the role of oxytocin in women's attachment, affiliation and aggression are discussed.
17932111	Clinical and laboratory characteristics of hypernatraemia in an internal medicine clinic.	BACKGROUND: Hypernatraemia is a frequent electrolyte disorder in hospitalized patients that has been mainly studied in an entire hospital population. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence, clinical characteristics, concomitant electrolyte abnormalities and outcome of hypernatraemia in an internal medicine clinic. Also, we sought to identify differences between patients who were admitted with hypernatraemia and those who developed hypernatraemia during hospitalization. METHODS: We prospectively studied patients who either on admission to our internal medicine clinic or during their hospitalization were found to have hypernatraemia (sodium concentration greater than 148 meq/l, 148 mmol/l). One hundred and thirteen patients out of 9158 patients at risk had hypernatraemia (incidence 1.2%). Of those, fifty patients had hypernatraemia on admission, whereas 63 had hospital-acquired hypernatraemia. RESULTS: Patients who developed hypernatraemia before hospital admission had a much lower mortality rate than patients with hospital-acquired hypernatraemia (28% vs 47.6%, P=0.03), despite the fact that they had a higher peak serum sodium concentration (160.4+/-9.9 vs 154.4+/-2.4 meq/l, P=0.000). Furthermore, they did not differ in either age or the frequency of concomitant electrolyte abnormalities in comparison with patients who developed hypernatraemia during hospitalization. There were two main subgroups of patients with hospital-acquired hypernatraemia. A total of 26 Patients (41%) exhibited a biochemical profile consistent with extracellular volume depletion, whereas 32 patients (51%) with euvolaemia. On the contrary, the majority of patients (82%) who were hypernatraemic on admission had hypovolaemic hypernatraemia. The construction of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) plots revealed that the urea to creatinine ratio was the best predictor of the extracellular volume status. Indeed, a urea to creatinine value of 57 could differentiate between the groups with euvolaemic or hypovolaemic hypernatraemia with a sensitivity of 96.5% and a specificity of 100%. CONCLUSION: The incidence of hypernatraemia in the present study was 1.2% with a high mortality rate mainly in patients with hospital-acquired hypernatraemia. There were two main profiles of hospital-acquired hypernatraemia, one consistent with extracellular volume depletion and another with euvolaemia. On the contrary, the majority of hypernatraemic patients on admission exhibited hypovolaemia. Almost half of our hypernatraemic patients had at least one additional electrolyte disturbance.
17932121	Salbutamol increases SMN mRNA and protein levels in spinal muscular atrophy cells.	Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an inherited neuromuscular disorder caused by homozygous absence of the survival motor neuron gene (SMN1). All patients have at least one, usually two to four copies of the related SMN2 gene which, however, produce insufficient levels of functional SMN protein due to the exclusion of exon 7 in the majority of SMN2 transcripts. Here, we show that salbutamol, a beta2-adrenoceptor agonist, determines a rapid and significant increase in SMN2-full length mRNA and SMN protein in SMA fibroblasts, predominantly by promoting exon 7 inclusion in SMN2 transcripts. These data, together with previous clinical findings, provide a strong rationale to investigate further the clinical efficacy of salbutamol in SMA patients.
17932381	Continued exposure to maternal distress in early life is associated with an increased risk of childhood asthma.	RATIONALE: Evidence is emerging that exposure to maternal distress in early life plays a causal role in the development of childhood asthma. OBJECTIVES: Because much of the data are from high-risk cohorts, we undertook a birth cohort study in a complete population of children to test this association. METHODS: Using Manitoba, Canada's, health care and prescription databases, this longitudinal study assessed the association between maternal distress during the first year of life and onward, and asthma at age 7 in a 1995 birth cohort of 13,907 children. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Maternal distress was defined on the basis of health care or prescription medication use for depression or anxiety. Asthma status was derived from health care and prescription records for asthma, using a definition validated by comparison to pediatric allergist diagnosis. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine the likelihood of asthma (odds ratio [OR], 95% confidence interval [95% CI]). Independent of well-known asthma risk factors, our population-based study of a non-high-risk cohort demonstrated an increased risk of childhood asthma (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.01-1.55) among children exposed to continued maternal distress from birth until age 7. Exposure to maternal depression and anxiety limited to the first year of life did not have a demonstrable association with subsequent asthma. Of interest, we observed that the risk of asthma associated with continued maternal distress was increased in children living in high- versus low-income households (OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.12-1.85). CONCLUSIONS: Maternal distress in early life plays a role in the development of childhood asthma, especially if it continues beyond the postpartum period.
17932394	Primary diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the breast: prognostic factors and outcomes of a study by the International Extranodal Lymphoma Study Group.	BACKGROUND: Primary diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) of breast is rare. We aimed to define clinical features, prognostic factors, patterns of failure, and treatment outcomes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective international study of 204 eligible patients presenting to the International Extranodal Lymphoma Study Group-affiliated institutions from 1980 to 2003. RESULTS: Median age was 64 years, with 95% of patients presenting with unilateral disease. Median overall survival (OS) was 8.0 years, and median progression-free survival 5.5 years. In multifactor analysis, favourable International Prognostic Index score, anthracycline-containing chemotherapy, and radiotherapy (RT) were significantly associated with longer OS (each P < or = 0.03). There was no benefit from mastectomy, as opposed to biopsy or lumpectomy only. At a median follow-up time of 5.5 years, 37% of patients had progressed--16% in the same or contralateral breast, 5% in the central nervous system, and 14% in other extranodal sites. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of limited surgery, anthracycline-containing chemotherapy, and involved-field RT produced the best outcome in the pre-rituximab era. A prospective trial on the basis of these results should be pursued to confirm these observations and to determine whether the impact of rituximab on the patterns of relapse and outcome parallels that of DLBCL presenting at other sites.
17932403	Early motion after quadriceps and patellar tendon repairs: outcomes with single-suture augmentation.	BACKGROUND: Complications of immobilization after quadriceps and patellar tendon repairs include decreased patellar mobility, limited flexion, persistent pain, muscle weakness, and patella baja. In contrast, early motion limits muscle atrophy, accelerates tendon healing, and prevents joint stiffness. HYPOTHESIS: Quadriceps and patellar tendon repairs protected with a "relaxing suture" are strong enough to safely permit early motion, full weightbearing, and brace-free ambulation. STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: Twenty quadriceps and 30 patellar tendon ruptures were treated with a primary repair augmented with a single No. 5 Ethibond suture, a postoperative regimen of controlled motion and full weightbearing at 7 to 10 days, and brace-free ambulation at 6 weeks after surgery. At a minimum follow-up of 12 months, results of surgery were assessed with the Lysholm knee rating system. RESULTS: Six weeks after surgery, 120 degrees of flexion and brace-free ambulation were the goals and were achieved at a mean of 7.2 and 7.7 weeks, respectively. By 6 months, all patients reached their preinjury levels of activity (eg, basketball, softball, Rocky Mountain tour guide), 40 had full active extension, and 10 lacked 3 degrees to 10 degrees of active extension. There were no postoperative complications. At a mean follow-up of 4 years (range, 1-12 years), the Lysholm scores averaged 92 points (range, 84-100 points), and there were 35 excellent, 15 good, and no fair or poor results. CONCLUSION: Quadriceps and patellar tendon repairs protected by a relaxing suture were strong enough to safely permit early motion, weightbearing, and brace-free ambulation while producing good and excellent results.
17932690	Epidermal growth factor receptor gene amplification and gefitinib sensitivity in patients with recurrent lung cancer.	To evaluate the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) protein expression, gene mutations and amplification as predictors of clinical outcome in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) receiving gefitinib, we have performed fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). We investigated the EGFR amplification and EGFR protein expression statuses in 27 surgically treated non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases. These patients experienced relapse after surgery and received gefitinib 250 mg/day. The presence or absence of EGFR mutations of kinase domains was analyzed by genotyping analysis and sequences, and already reported. EGFR mutations were found from 15/27 lung cancer patients. EGFR mutation status was significantly correlated with better prognosis (log-rank test P=0.0023). Smoking status (never smoker vs. smoker, P=0.0032), and pathological subtypes (adenocarcinoma vs. non-adenocarcinoma, P=0.0011), but not EGFR amplification (P=0.1278), were correlated with survival of lung cancers. EGFR IHC results were correlated with FISH results (P=0.0125), but not correlated with prognosis (P=0.7921). Thus, the EGFR gene amplification or protein expression is not a predictor of gefitinib efficacy in Japanese patients with NSCLC. We have also evaluated the EGFR mutation status and clinico-pathological features for 27 NSCLC patients who had undergone surgery followed by treatment with gefitinib at the National Hospital Organization, Kinki-chuo Chest Medical Center. The EGFR mutation status, especially exon19 mutation was correlated with good response to gefitinib than exon 21 point mutation.
17932746	Resistance exercise: training adaptations and developing a safe exercise prescription.	The safety and efficacy of resistance exercise training (RT) in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) are critically reviewed. Evidence-based recommendations for designing safe RT programs are also presented to help clinicians and rehabilitation professionals formulate exercise prescriptions for their patients. To the extent possible, the separate and independent effects of RT on patients with CHF are discussed. Clinical prognosis (i.e. risk stratification) and exercise capacity in patients with CHF are determined by the mitigating effects of both central hemodynamics and peripheral pathophysiology. Despite the well-described skeletal muscle wasting and myopathy in heart failure, aerobic exercise remains by far the most prescribed training modality in patients with CHF. This article presents evidence that improvement of skeletal muscle phenotype (muscle mass, fiber morphology, and histochemistry) should be a fundamental goal of rehabilitation in patients with CHF. Moreover, RT may be the preferred exercise modality when targeting the periphery for muscle phenotype adaptation.
17932781	Overexpression of HVA1 gene from barley generates tolerance to salinity and water stress in transgenic mulberry (Morus indica).	Late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins are members of a large group of hydrophilic proteins found primarily in plants. The barley hva1 gene encodes a group 3 LEA protein and is induced by ABA and water deficit conditions. We report here the over expression of hva1 in mulberry under a constitutive promoter via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Molecular analysis of the transgenic plants revealed the stable integration and expression of the transgene in the transformants. Transgenic plants were subjected to simulated salinity and drought stress conditions to study the role of hva1 in conferring tolerance. The transgenic plants showed better cellular membrane stability (CMS), photosynthetic yield, less photo-oxidative damage and better water use efficiency as compared to the non-transgenic plants under both salinity and drought stress. Under salinity stress, transgenic plants show many fold increase in proline concentration than the non-transgenic plants and under water deficit conditions proline is accumulated only in the non-transgenic plants. Results also indicate that the production of HVA1 proteins helps in better performance of transgenic mulberry by protecting membrane stability of plasma membrane as well as chloroplastic membranes from injury under abiotic stress. Interestingly, it was observed that hva1 conferred different degrees of tolerance to the transgenic plants towards various stress conditions. Amongst the lines analysed for stress tolerance transgenic line ST8 was relatively more salt tolerant, ST30, ST31 more drought tolerant, and lines ST11 and ST6 responded well under both salinity and drought stress conditions as compared to the non-transgenic plants. Thus hva1 appears to confer a broad spectrum of tolerance under abiotic stress in mulberry.
17932917	Prediction of RNA binding sites in a protein using SVM and PSSM profile.	RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play key roles in post-transcriptional control of gene expression, which, along with transcriptional regulation, is a major way to regulate patterns of gene expression during development. Thus, the identification and prediction of RNA binding sites is an important step in comprehensive understanding of how RBPs control organism development. Combining evolutionary information and support vector machine (SVM), we have developed an improved method for predicting RNA binding sites or RNA interacting residues in a protein sequence. The prediction models developed in this study have been trained and tested on 86 RNA binding protein chains and evaluated using fivefold cross validation technique. First, a SVM model was developed that achieved a maximum Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.31. The performance of this SVM model further improved the MCC from 0.31 to 0.45, when multiple sequence alignment in the form of PSSM profiles was used as input to the SVM, which is far better than the maximum MCC achieved by previous methods (0.41) on the same dataset. In addition, SVM models were also developed on an alternative dataset that contained 107 RBP chains. Utilizing PSSM as input information to the SVM, the training/testing on this alternate dataset achieved a maximum MCC of 0.32. Conclusively, the prediction performance of SVM models developed in this study is better than the existing methods on the same datasets. A web server 'Pprint' was also developed for predicting RNA binding residues in a protein sequence which is freely available at http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/pprint/.
17932961	A specific attentional bias in panic disorder?	According to cognitive theories, panic patients are assumed to have an attentional bias toward bodily sensations. To date, there is only some indirect evidence of such a bias measured by an emotional Stroop task. Moreover, the content and disorder specificity of this bias is rather unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the specificity of attentional bias in patients with panic disorder (PD). Patients with PD (n=32), patients with mixed anxiety disorders (n=25), and a healthy control group (n=26) performed an emotional Stroop task with three word types: panic threat, general threat, and neutral. There were no differences on reaction times between the different groups, or on the different word types. Despite the generally accepted existence of attentional biases in anxiety disorders, we found no evidence of a specific attentional bias in patients with PD.
17933520	Neuronal actions of glucocorticoids: focus on depression.	Stress, acting through glucocorticoids (GC), has profound effects on brain physiology and pathology and is causally implicated in depressive illness. Here, we consider the information derived from genetic models generated to probe the role of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis in depression. This essay also briefly reviews the status of knowledge regarding GC actions on neuronal birth, survival and death from the perspective of the importance of these phenomena in depression.
17933543	Acridones circumvent P-glycoprotein-associated multidrug resistance (MDR) in cancer cells.	Multidrug resistance (MDR) mediated by overexpression of MDR1 P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is one of the best characterized transporter-mediated barriers to successful chemotherapy in cancer patients. Chemosensitizers are the agents that increase the sensitivity of multidrug-resistant cells to the toxic influence of previously less effective drugs. In an attempt to find such vital chemosensitizers, a series of N(10)-substituted-2-chloroacridone analogous (1-17) have been synthesized. Compound 1 was prepared by the Ullmann condensation of o-chlorobenzoic acid and p-chloroaniline followed by cyclization. The N-(omega-chloroalkyl) analogues were found to undergo iodide catalyzed nucleophilic substitution reaction with secondary amines and the resultant products were characterized by spectral methods. The lipophilicity expressed in log(10)P and pK(a) of compounds has been determined. All compounds were examined for their ability to increase the uptake of vinblastine (VLB) in MDR KBCh(R)-8-5 cells and the results showed that the compounds 6, 8, 11-14, 16, and 17 at their respective IC(50) concentrations caused a 1.0- to 1.7-fold greater accumulation of VLB than did a similar concentration of the standard modulator, verapamil (VRP). Results of the efflux experiment showed that VRP and each of the modulators significantly inhibited the efflux of VLB, suggesting that they may be competitors for P-gp. All modulators effectively competing with [(3)H]azidopine for binding to P-gp pointed out this transport membrane protein as their likely site of action. Compounds at IC(10) were evaluated for their efficacy to modulate the cytotoxicity of VLB and the results showed that modulators 11, 13, 14, 16, and 17 were able to completely reverse the 25-fold resistance of KBCh(R)-8-5 cells to VLB. Examination of the relationship between lipophilicity and antagonism of MDR showed a reasonable correlation suggesting that hydrophobicity is one of the determinants of potency for anti-MDR activity of 2-chloroacridones. The results allowed us to draw preliminary conclusions about structural features of 2-chloroacridones important for MDR modulation.
17933775	Gallus GBrowse: a unified genomic database for the chicken.	Gallus GBrowse (http://birdbase.net/cgi-bin/gbrowse/gallus/) provides online access to genomic and other information about the chicken, Gallus gallus. The information provided by this resource includes predicted genes and Gene Ontology (GO) terms, links to Gallus In Situ Hybridization Analysis (GEISHA), Unigene and Reactome, the genomic positions of chicken genetic markers, SNPs and microarray probes, and mappings from turkey, condor and zebra finch DNA and EST sequences to the chicken genome. We also provide a BLAT server (http://birdbase.net/cgi-bin/webBlat) for matching user-provided sequences to the chicken genome. These tools make the Gallus GBrowse server a valuable resource for researchers seeking genomic information regarding the chicken and other avian species.
17934214	Analysis of the Arabidopsis cytosolic ribosome proteome provides detailed insights into its components and their post-translational modification.	Finding gene-specific peptides by mass spectrometry analysis to pinpoint gene loci responsible for particular protein products is a major challenge in proteomics especially in highly conserved gene families in higher eukaryotes. We used a combination of in silico approaches coupled to mass spectrometry analysis to advance the proteomics insight into Arabidopsis cytosolic ribosomal composition and its post-translational modifications. In silico digestion of all 409 ribosomal protein sequences in Arabidopsis defined the proportion of theoretical gene-specific peptides for each gene family and highlighted the need for low m/z cutoffs of MS ion selection for MS/MS to characterize low molecular weight, highly basic ribosomal proteins. We undertook an extensive MS/MS survey of the cytosolic ribosome using trypsin and, when required, chymotrypsin and pepsin. We then used custom software to extract and filter peptide match information from Mascot result files and implement high confidence criteria for calling gene-specific identifications based on the highest quality unambiguous spectra matching exclusively to certain in silico predicted gene- or gene family-specific peptides. This provided an in-depth analysis of the protein composition based on 1446 high quality MS/MS spectra matching to 795 peptide sequences from ribosomal proteins. These identified peptides from five gene families of ribosomal proteins not identified previously, providing experimental data on 79 of the 80 different types of ribosomal subunits. We provide strong evidence for gene-specific identification of 87 different ribosomal proteins from these 79 families. We also provide new information on 30 specific sites of co- and post-translational modification of ribosomal proteins in Arabidopsis by initiator methionine removal, N-terminal acetylation, N-terminal methylation, lysine N-methylation, and phosphorylation. These site-specific modification data provide a wealth of resources for further assessment of the role of ribosome modification in influencing translation in Arabidopsis.
17934292	Fetal facial profile in Pallister-Killian syndrome.	Pallister-Killian syndrome (PKS) is a sporadic chromosomal anomaly, caused by a tissue-specific mosaic distribution of an additional isochromosome 12p. About 60 cases of prenatal diagnosis of PKS have been reported. Only 1 case of PKS is described on the basis of prenatal screening, presenting increased nuchal translucency. An abnormal fetal facial profile is described prenatally as sonographic evidence of PKS. We report a case of prenatal diagnosis in a fetus undergoing second-level scan due to positive triple screen with ultrasound features of PKS.
17934726	Comparative findings of voice and speech: language processing at an early ontogenetic age in quantitative EEG mapping.	Quantitative EEG mapping in powers of electrical activity, concentration of main powers and area of concentration in relation to the side of presentation (left, right, and bihemisphery) and closer location was done on a 24-day-old infant first, and again when the infant was 2.5 months. EEG responses are analyzed in following acoustic modalities: (1) specific (native language speech of mother and unfamiliar female, unfamiliar female speech of foreign language); (2) unspecific (passive period). Familiar and unfamiliar texts present the contents of speech material. Comparative findings on two different ages showed that the infant maintains the processing scheme of unfamiliar stimulus (passive period, foreign language), and also very similar processing scheme of unfamiliar voice regardless if the text in native language is familiar or unfamiliar. During stimulation with familiar or unfamiliar text in native language, which is read by mother, processing type is significantly changed in relation to the age at the time of examination. While a 24-day-old infant shows a similar scheme in processing the familiar and the unfamiliar voices in native language, at the age of 2.5 months, this scheme of processing is changed, especially for theta rhythm, which now has bihemisphery presentation (at earlier stage it has right-side presentation) in the F-C-P region, what is practically the same region where also delta rhythm is processed. However, the sample of unfamiliar voice in native language observed in subsequent period, when the infant was 2.5 months old, maintains the same processing location as it has at an earlier ontogenetic stage, when the infant was 24 days old, regarding the theta rhythm processed in the F-C-P region with right-side presentation, and delta rhythm processed in C-P region with bihemisphery presentation. Post stimuli periods observed when the infant was 2.5 months old show obviously differentiation of theta and delta rhythms' samples and their electrophysiological parameters. The samples of familiar and unfamiliar texts in native language when read by mother (familiar voice) begin to differentiate regarding to closer location and number of centers for maximal powers in theta rhythm at subsequent ontogenetic period (2.5-month-old infant). The samples of quantitative EEG mapping for a 2.5-months-old infant show the signs of complex processing of different stimuli types: known/unknown voice, foreign language, with stronger inclusion of parietal regions, bihemisphery and an increase in number of maximal powers' centers, compared to the samples when the infant was 42 days old. Quantitative EEG electrophysiological parameters are discussed in relation to side representation and closer regional location with the aim of explaining the processing of complex speech and language stimulation in relation to certain characteristics in its bases.
17935148	Use of estimated evolutionary strength at the codon level improves the prediction of disease-related protein mutations in humans.	Predicting the functional impact of protein variation is one of the most challenging problems in bioinformatics. A rapidly growing number of genome-scale studies provide large amounts of experimental data, allowing the application of rigorous statistical approaches for predicting whether a given single point mutation has an impact on human health. Up until now, existing methods have limited their source data to either protein or gene information. Novel in this work, we take advantage of both and focus on protein evolutionary information by using estimated selective pressures at the codon level. Here we introduce a new method (SeqProfCod) to predict the likelihood that a given protein variant is associated with human disease or not. Our method relies on a support vector machine (SVM) classifier trained using three sources of information: protein sequence, multiple protein sequence alignments, and the estimation of selective pressure at the codon level. SeqProfCod has been benchmarked with a large dataset of 8,987 single point mutations from 1,434 human proteins from SWISS-PROT. It achieves 82% overall accuracy and a correlation coefficient of 0.59, indicating that the estimation of the selective pressure helps in predicting the functional impact of single-point mutations. Moreover, this study demonstrates the synergic effect of combining two sources of information for predicting the functional effects of protein variants: protein sequence/profile-based information and the evolutionary estimation of the selective pressures at the codon level. The results of large-scale application of SeqProfCod over all annotated point mutations in SWISS-PROT (available for download at http://sgu.bioinfo.cipf.es/services/Omidios/; last accessed: 24 August 2007), could be used to support clinical studies.
17935178	Hepatocyte transplantation and drug-induced perturbations in liver cell compartments.	UNLABELLED: The potential for organ damage after using drugs or chemicals is a critical issue in medicine. To delineate mechanisms of drug-induced hepatic injury, we used transplanted cells as reporters in dipeptidyl peptidase IV-deficient mice. These mice were given phenytoin and rifampicin for 3 days, after which monocrotaline was given followed 1 day later by intrasplenic transplantation of healthy C57BL/6 mouse hepatocytes. We examined endothelial and hepatic damage by serologic or tissue studies and assessed changes in transplanted cell engraftment and liver repopulation by histochemical staining for dipeptidyl peptidase IV. Monocrotaline caused denudation of the hepatic sinusoidal endothelium and increased serum hyaluronic acid levels, along with superior transplanted cell engraftment. Together, phenytoin, rifampicin, and monocrotaline caused further endothelial damage, reflected by greater improvement in cell engraftment. Phenytoin, rifampicin, and monocrotaline produced injury in hepatocytes that was not apparent after conventional tissue studies. This led to transplanted cell proliferation and extensive liver repopulation over several weeks, which was more efficient in males compared with females, including greater induction by phenytoin and rifampicin of cytochrome P450 3A4 isoform that converts monocrotaline to toxic intermediates. Through this and other possible mechanisms, monocrotaline-induced injury in the endothelial compartment was retargeted to simultaneously involve hepatocytes over the long term. Moreover, after this hepatic injury, native liver cells were more susceptible to additional pro-oxidant injury through thyroid hormone, which accelerated the kinetics of liver repopulation. CONCLUSION: Transplanted reporter cells will be useful for obtaining insights into homeostatic mechanisms involving liver cell compartments, whereas targeted injury in hepatic endothelial and parenchymal cells with suitable drugs will also help advance liver cell therapy.
17935204	Vitamin D receptor distribution in intestines of domesticated sheep Ovis ammon f. aries.	The biologically active form of vitamin D, i.e., 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol or calcitriol, plays an important role in bone metabolism and calcium homeostasis, which is often disturbed at the onset of lactation in high milk-yielding domestic ruminants. Gene transcription is modulated via vitamin D receptors, but nongenomic effects of vitamin D via membrane receptors have also been described. In the intestines, vitamin D promotes calcium absorption via vitamin D receptors. Vitamin D receptors are of clinical relevance, but have not been systematically assessed within all segments of the intestine in any species. Thus, we present for the first time an immunohistochemical study of the distribution patterns of the vitamin D receptor protein in sheep, which may be the basis for present and future investigations on mineral homeostasis in domestic ruminants. Tissue probes of the intestines were collected from five lambs and five nonlactating and nonpregnant dams, fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin, and used for the assessment of vitamin D receptor protein. Nuclear vitamin D receptor immunoreaction was scored semiquantitatively and exhibited a segment-specific distribution pattern. Goblet cells always were devoid of any vitamin D receptor immunoreaction. Surface epithelial cells and enterocytes of the crypt openings generally demonstrated only a weak immunoreaction. Basally and/or intermediately located crypt epithelial cells exhibited stronger immunoreactions in duodenum, jejunum, and colon descendens. This basal/intermediate to superficial gradient was most pronounced in the duodenum and less evident in jejunum and colon descendens and not observed in ileum and cecum. There were no age-dependent variations in vitamin D receptor protein expression. Results demonstrate that intestinal vitamin D receptor distribution patterns are segment-specific and strongest immunoreactions correlate with highest intestinal calcium absorptive activities, as reported in literature. Strong expression of vitamin D receptors within the lower half of crypts also suggests a role for calcitriol in epithelial differentiation and cellular homeostasis.
17935206	Social isolation in prairie voles induces behaviors relevant to negative affect: toward the development of a rodent model focused on co-occurring depression and anxiety.	Recent evidence suggests substantial overlap between mood and anxiety disorders, both in clinical presentation and associated features. A theoretical framework to account for this overlap focuses on negative affectivity, defined as the disposition to experience negative emotional states, including fear, sadness, and guilt. This model has been successful in explaining the co-occurrence of depressive and anxiety disorders in humans. As a next step, development of an animal model focused on both depression- and anxiety-relevant behaviors may advance understanding of depression-anxiety symptom overlap, relations of these disorders with associated medical conditions and responses to treatment. This study was designed to investigate inducible and quantifiable depression- and anxiety-like behaviors in prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster). Adult, female prairie voles were exposed to 4 weeks of social pairing (control) or isolation, an established stressor for socially monogamous mammals (including humans). Operational measures of depression (sucrose intake and behaviors in the forced swim test), anxiety (behaviors in the elevated plus maze), and aggression (responses to an unrelated prairie vole pup) were investigated. Social isolation induced a progressive decline in sucrose intake and increased immobility time during the forced swim test. Social isolation also decreased the amount of time spent in the open arms of the elevated plus maze, and increased pup-directed attack behavior. The current findings suggest that isolation induces behaviors reflecting elevated negative affect. These results may provide a foundation for creating a rodent model to examine the mechanisms underlying comorbid mood and anxiety disorders.
17935773	Studies on the interaction of isoxazolcurcumin with calf thymus DNA.	The interaction of isoxazolcurcumin (IOC), a synthetic derivative of curcumin, with calf thymus-DNA (ct-DNA) has been investigated by UV-Vis, fluorescence, circular dichroism spectroscopies, viscosity measurements and docking studies. From these analyses, the binding constant, number of binding sites and mode of binding of IOC to ct-DNA has been determined. The binding constant of IOC to DNA calculated from both UV-Vis and CD spectra was found to be in the 10(4)M(-1) range. Analyses of fluorescence spectra, viscosity measurements and molecular modeling of IOC-DNA interactions indicate that IOC is a minor groove binder of ct-DNA and preferentially binds to AT rich regions. Ethidium bromide displacement studies revealed that IOC did not have any effect on ethidium bromide bound DNA which is indicative of groove binding. To elucidate the preferred region of binding of IOC to DNA, docking studies have been performed and changes in accessible surface area (DeltaASA) of nucleobases determined due to IOC-DNA complexation.
17936071	Multiple origins of the symbioses in Paramecium bursaria.	Many organisms have symbioses with photosynthetic algae as typified by corals, clams, lichens, and some protozoa. Paramecium bursaria contains green algal symbionts and this unicellular ciliate is a textbook example used for microscopic observation in junior high school science projects. We have determined molecular phylogenies for the green algal symbionts. The symbiotic algae are the main constituent of the Paramecium cytoplasm, and we have recognized a total of four species, of which two were newly discovered in the present study. One should be regarded genetically as Chlorella vulgaris, and it belongs phylogenetically to the Chlorella clade (Chlorellaceae, Trebouxiophyceae) as well as "American" and "European" groups, which we previously introduced. Their genetic dissimilarities are 0.50-0.83% in 18S rDNA comparisons, but those of the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) reach an unambiguous level (22.6-26.6%). These dissimilarities suggest that they are equivalent to discrete species derived from multiple origins as paramecian symbionts. Another newcomer was clearly separated from the Chlorellaceae, and this alga clustered with Coccomyxa spp. in ITS2 analyses. These symbiotic relations indicate multiple origins of symbionts.
17936643	Does caffeine modulate verbal working memory processes? An fMRI study.	To assess the effect of caffeine on the functional MRI signal during a 2-back verbal working memory task, we examined blood oxygenation level-dependent regional brain activity in 15 healthy right-handed males. The subjects, all moderate caffeine consumers, underwent two scanning sessions on a 1.5-T MR-Scanner separated by a 24- to 48-h interval. Each participant received either placebo or 100 mg caffeine 20 min prior to the performance of the working memory task in blinded crossover fashion. The study was implemented as a blocked-design. Analysis was performed using SPM2. In both conditions, the characteristic working memory network of frontoparietal cortical activation including the precuneus and the anterior cingulate could be shown. In comparison to placebo, caffeine caused an increased response in the bilateral medial frontopolar cortex (BA 10), extending to the right anterior cingulate cortex (BA 32). These results suggest that caffeine modulates neuronal activity as evidenced by fMRI signal changes in a network of brain areas associated with executive and attentional functions during working memory processes.
17938114	Production of transgenic adult plants from clementine mandarin by enhancing cell competence for transformation and regeneration.	Genetic transformation of mature trees is difficult because adult tissues are recalcitrant to Agrobacterium tumefaciens infection and transformation and because transgenic mature events are less competent for regeneration. We have shown that reinvigoration allows manipulation of the vegetative phase to increase the potential for transformation and regeneration without loss of competence for flowering and fruiting. To produce transgenic plants from clementine mandarin (Citrus clementina hort. ex Tanaka), we optimized the conditions of the source material both ex vitro and in vitro. Grafting of mature buds on juvenile rootstocks in the spring and preventing multiple bud sprouting by removing all but one bud permitted selection of vigorous first flushes for in vitro culture. Use of additional virulence genes from A. tumefaciens to increase transformation frequency and optimization of culture media and conditions to enhance explant cell competence for T-DNA integration and organogenesis resulted in efficient and reliable transgenic plant production. Transformed regenerants from explants, cultured in media without antibiotics, were identified by a screenable marker (either beta-glucuronidase or green fluorescent protein (GFP)), creating the possibility of generating transgenic clementine plants without antibiotic resistance marker genes. Stable integration of foreign genes was demonstrated by Southern blot analysis, and expression of these foreign genes was confirmed by detection of GFP fluorescence in leaves, floral organs and fruits of the transgenic plants.
17938212	A carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 homologue plays a pivotal role in nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae colonization of the chinchilla nasopharynx via the outer membrane protein P5-homologous adhesin.	In vitro studies suggest an important role for CEACAM1 (carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1) in infection by multiple gram-negative bacteria. However, in vivo evidence supporting this role is lacking, largely because the bacterial adhesins involved in this host-microbe association do not bind to murine-derived CEACAM1. One of several adhesins expressed by nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI), the outer membrane protein P5-homologous adhesin (or P5), is essential for colonization of the chinchilla nasopharynx and infection of the middle ear. Here we reveal that NTHI P5 binds to the chinchilla homologue of CEACAM1 and that rabbit anti-human carcinoembryonic antigen blocks NTHI colonization of the chinchilla nasopharynx, providing the first demonstration of a role for CEACAM receptor binding by any bacterial pathogen in vivo.
17938969	Neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus.	New neurons continue to be generated in two privileged areas of the adult brain: the dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation and the olfactory bulb. Adult neurogenesis has been found in all mammals studied to date, including humans. The process of adult neurogenesis encompasses the proliferation of resident neural stem and progenitor cells and their subsequent differentiation, migration, and functional integration into the pre-existing circuitry. This article summarizes recent findings regarding the developmental steps involved in adult hippocampal neurogenesis and the possible functional roles that new hippocampal neurons might play.
17939025	Identification and characterization of a single-stranded DNA-binding protein from thermophilic bacteriophage GVE2.	Single-stranded DNA-binding (SSB) proteins are indispensable for survival of almost all known living organisms. Due to their numerous applications in diverse molecular biology and analytical methods, SSB proteins have received increasing research interest. In this investigation, a novel SSB gene was identified from a deep-sea thermophilic bacteriophage Geobacillus virus E2 (GVE2) for the first time. The GVE2 SSB protein shared homologies to known SSB proteins from other species. After recombinant expression in E. coli, the purified SSB protein was used for antibody preparation. The Northern and Western blots showed that the GVE2 SSB gene might be an early viral gene. As revealed by DNA binding assay, the recombinant GVE2 SSB protein had single-stranded DNA binding capacity.
17940120	Nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice congenic for a targeted deletion of 12/15-lipoxygenase are protected from autoimmune diabetes.	OBJECTIVE: 12/15-lipoxygenase (12/15-LO), one of a family of fatty acid oxidoreductase enzymes, reacts with polyenoic fatty acids to produce proinflammatory lipids. 12/15-LO is expressed in macrophages and pancreatic beta-cells. It enhances interleukin 12 production by macrophages, and several of its products induce apoptosis of beta-cells at nanomolar concentrations in vitro. We had previously demonstrated a role for 12/15-LO in beta-cell damage in the streptozotocin model of diabetes. Since the gene encoding 12/15-LO (gene designation Alox15) lies within the Idd4 diabetes susceptibility interval in NOD mice, we hypothesized that 12/15-LO is also a key regulator of diabetes susceptibility in the NOD mouse. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We developed NOD mice carrying an inactivated 12/15-LO locus (NOD-Alox15(null)) using a "speed congenic" protocol, and the mice were monitored for development of insulitis and diabetes. RESULTS: NOD mice deficient in 12/15-LO develop diabetes at a markedly reduced rate compared with NOD mice (2.5 vs. >60% in females by 30 weeks). Nondiabetic female NOD-Alox15(null) mice demonstrate improved glucose tolerance, as well as significantly reduced severity of insulitis and improved beta-cell mass, when compared with age-matched nondiabetic NOD females. Disease resistance is associated with decreased numbers of islet-infiltrating activated macrophages at 4 weeks of age in NOD-Alox15(null) mice, preceding the development of insulitis. Subsequently, islet-associated infiltrates are characterized by decreased numbers of CD4(+) T cells and increased Foxp3(+) cells. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest an important role for 12/15-LO in conferring susceptibility to autoimmune diabetes in NOD mice through its effects on macrophage recruitment or activation.
17940556	Dietary wheat reduction decreases the level of urinary deoxynivalenol in UK adults.	In animals deoxynivalenol (DON) causes vomiting, feed refusal, growth retardation, and affects the immune system. DON is a common contaminant of wheat, however, validated biomarker data to assess exposure at the individual level and therefore any associated health effects are lacking. The development of a highly robust assay for urinary DON involving immunoaffinity (IAC) clean-up and liquid chromatography (LC)-mass spectrometric (MS) detection has allowed the assessment of (1) DON exposure within UK individuals and (2) a wheat intake intervention on urinary DON levels. Twenty-five volunteers from the United Kingdom (aged 21-59 years) completed semi-weighed food diaries on days 1 and 2 (normal diet), and a morning urine sample was provided on day 3. On days 3-6 (intervention), individuals restricted major sources of wheat intake following dietary guidance. Diaries were completed on days 5 and 6, and a further morning urine was provided on day 7. Urinary DON was measured following IAC clean-up and analysis by LC-MS. Wheat-based food intake (mean 322 g/day, range: 131-542 g/day), was significantly (P<0.001) reduced during the intervention to 26 g/day (range: 0-159 g/day) indicating good compliance. DON was detected in all 25 urine samples taken on day 3 (geometric mean 7.2 ng DON/mg creatinine (95% confidence interval (CI) 4.9-10.5 ng/mg), but following the intervention there was a significant 11-fold reduction (P<0.001) to 0.6 ng per mg (95% CI 0.4-0.9 ng/mg). These data are unique in demonstrating human exposure to DON in the United Kingdom using a urinary biomarker. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that exposure can be markedly reduced by avoiding wheat in the diet. On the basis of urinary biomarker levels some individuals are predicted to exceed current recommended daily intakes of DON, and thus the health consequences of these exposures merit further investigation.
17940868	Organophosphorous insecticides as herbicide synergists on the green algae Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and the aquatic plant Lemna minor.	Models proposed for risk assessment of chemical mixtures assume no interactions between the chemicals. There are, however, studies indicating that some organophosporous insecticides can inhibit the detoxification of other chemicals in plants thereby enhancing their effect. The present study investigates whether interactions between selected organophosporous insecticides and herbicides can take place in the aquatic algae Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and the aquatic macrophyte Lemna minor. For both species binary mixtures of the organophosphate insecticides: malathion, endosulfan and chlorpyrifos were tested together with the herbicides metsulfuron-methyl, terbutylazine and bentazone. For mixtures with malathion on algae, dose-response surfaces were made and the results tested against the model of concentration addition (CA) and independent action (IA). The Lemna minor tests showed no indication of synergy for any of the combinations, on the contrary, significant antagonism was found for several of the mixtures. The response surface analysis showed antagonism in relation to both concentration addition and independent action for mixtures between malathion and metsulfuron-methyl and terbuthylazine, while the mixtures with bentazone could be explained with CA. The study shows no indications of synergistic interactions between the tested pesticides, confirming the applicability of CA as a reference model predicting mixture effects of pesticides for aquatic plants and algae.
17941803	Identification of the cysteine nitrosylation sites in human endothelial nitric oxide synthase.	S-nitrosylation, or the replacement of the hydrogen atom in the thiol group of cysteine residues by a -NO moiety, is a physiologically important posttranslational modification. In our previous work we have shown that S-nitrosylation is involved in the disruption of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) dimer and that this involves the disruption of the zinc (Zn) tetrathiolate cluster due to the S-nitrosylation of Cysteine 98. However, human eNOS contains 28 other cysteine residues whose potential to undergo S-nitrosylation has not been determined. Thus, the goal of this study was to identify the cysteine residues within eNOS that are susceptible to S-nitrosylation in vitro. To accomplish this, we utilized a modified biotin switch assay. Our modification included the tryptic digestion of the S-nitrosylated eNOS protein to allow the isolation of S-nitrosylated peptides for further identification by mass spectrometry. Our data indicate that multiple cysteine residues are capable of undergoing S-nitrosylation in the presence of an excess of a nitrosylating agent. All these cysteine residues identified were found to be located on the surface of the protein according to the available X-ray structure of the oxygenase domain of eNOS. Among those identified were Cys 93 and 98, the residues involved in the formation of the eNOS dimer through a Zn tetrathiolate cluster. In addition, cysteine residues within the reductase domain were identified as undergoing S-nitrosylation. We identified cysteines 660, 801, and 1113 as capable of undergoing S-nitrosylation. These cysteines are located within regions known to bind flavin mononucleotide (FMN), flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADPH) although from our studies their functional significance is unclear. Finally we identified cysteines 852, 975/990, and 1047/1049 as being susceptible to S-nitrosylation. These cysteines are located in regions of eNOS that have not been implicated in any known biochemical functions and the significance of their S-nitrosylation is not clear from this study. Thus, our data indicate that the eNOS protein can be S-nitrosylated at multiple sites other than within the Zn tetrathiolate cluster, suggesting that S-nitrosylation may regulate eNOS function in ways other than simply by inducing dimer collapse.
17941824	Dominant-negative effect of Southeast Asian ovalocytosis anion exchanger 1 in compound heterozygous distal renal tubular acidosis.	The human chloride/bicarbonate AE1 (anion exchanger) is a dimeric glycoprotein expressed in the red blood cell membrane,and expressed as an N-terminal (Delta1-65) truncated form, kAE1(kidney AE1), in the basolateral membrane of alpha-intercalated cells in the distal nephron. Mutations in AE1 can cause SAO (Southeast Asian ovalocytosis) or dRTA (distal renal tubular acidosis), an inherited kidney disease resulting in impaired acid secretion. The dominant SAO mutation (Delta400-408) that results in an inactive transporter and altered erythrocyte shape occurs in manydRTA families, but does not itself result in dRTA. Compound heterozygotes of four dRTA mutations (R602H, G701D, DeltaV850 and A858D) with SAO exhibit dRTA and abnormal red blood cell properties. Co-expression of kAE1 and kAE1 SAO with the dRTAmutantswas studied in polarized epithelial MDCK(Madin-Darbycanine kidney) cells. Like SAO, the G701D and DeltaV850 mutants were predominantly retained intracellularly, whereas the R602H and A858D mutants could traffic to the basolateral membrane. When co-expressed in transfected cells, kAE1 WT (wild-type)and kAE1 SAO could interact with the dRTA mutants. MDCK cells co-expressing kAE1 SAO with kAE1 WT, kAE1 R602Hor kAE1 A858D showed a decrease in cell-surface expression of the co-expressed proteins. When co-expressed, kAE1 WT colocalized with the kAE1 R602H, kAE1 G701D, kAE1 DeltaV850 and kAE1 A858D mutants at the basolateral membrane, whereaskAE1 SAO co-localized with kAE1 WT, kAE1 R602H, kAE1 G701D, kAE1 DeltaV850 and kAE1 A858D in MDCK cells. The decrease in cell-surface expression of the dRTAmutants as a result of the interaction with kAE1 SAO would account for the impaired expression of functional kAE1 at the basolateral membrane of alpha-intercalated cells, resulting in dRTA in compound heterozygous patients.
17942248	Foot-and-mouth disease virus infection in young lambs: pathogenesis and tissue tropism.	Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in adult sheep usually causes milder clinical signs than in cattle or pigs, and is often subtle enough to go undiagnosed. In contrast, FMD in lambs has been reported to cause high mortality during field outbreaks. In order to investigate the pathogenesis of FMD in lambs, two groups, aged 10-14 days, were infected with foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) type O UKG. One group of lambs (n=8) was inoculated with FMDV in the coronary band, while the other (n=4) was infected by direct contact with FMDV-inoculated ewes. Daily serum samples and temperature measurements were taken. Lambs were killed sequentially and tissue samples taken for analysis. Using real-time RT-PCR, viral RNA levels in tissue samples and serum were measured, and a novel strand-specific real-time RT-PCR assay was used to quantify viral replication levels in tissues. Tissue sections were examined for histopathological lesions, and in situ hybridisation (ISH) was used to localise viral RNA within histological sections. The contact-infected lambs became infected approximately 24h after the ewes were inoculated. Vesicular lesions developed on the feet of all lambs and on the caudo-lateral part of the tongues of six of the eight inoculated lambs and three of the four contact-infected lambs. Although no lambs developed severe clinical signs, one of the contact-infected lambs died acutely at 5 days post-exposure. Histological examination of the heart from this lamb showed multi-focal areas of lymphocytic-plasmacytic myocarditis; similar lesions were also observed in the hearts of three of the inoculated lambs. Using ISH, viral RNA was localised within cardiac and skeletal muscle cells from the lamb which had died, and also from vesicular lesions on the coronary band and tongue of inoculated lambs. These results provide a detailed description of the pathogenesis of the disease in lambs.
17942362	Prevalence of pain and dysfunction in the cervical and thoracic spine in persons with and without lateral elbow pain.	The purpose of this study was to survey the prevalence of pain in the cervical and thoracic spine (C2-T7) in persons with and without lateral elbow pain. Thirty-one subjects with lateral elbow pain and 31 healthy controls participated in the study. The assessment comprised a pain drawing, provocation tests of the cervical and thoracic spine, a neurodynamic test of the radial nerve, and active cervical range of motion. Seventy percent of the subjects with lateral elbow pain indicated pain in the cervical or thoracic spine, as compared to 16% in the control group (p<0.001). The frequency of pain responses to the provocation tests of the cervical and thoracic spine was significantly higher (p<0.05) in the lateral elbow pain (LEP) group, as was the frequency of pain responses to the neurodynamic test of the radial nerve (p<0.001). Cervical flexion and extension range of motion was significantly lower (p<0.01) in the LEP group. The results indicate a relation between lateral elbow pain and pain in the vertebral spine (C2-T7). The cervical and thoracic spine should be included in the assessment of patients with lateral elbow pain.
17942371	CD8(+) T cells specific for both persistent and non-persistent viruses display distinct differentiation phenotypes but have similar level of PD-1 expression in healthy Chinese individuals.	Anti-viral CD8(+) T cell responses involve an initial expansion and effector phase, followed by contraction phase and formation of CD8(+) memory T cells. During this contraction phase, increased surface expression of the negative regulator PD-1 is associated with functional exhaustion of CD8(+) T cells. Although its role in T cell suppression has been established, the importance of PD-1 in the differentiation of CD8(+) T cells remains unclear. In this study, we examine PD-1 expression in relation to viral specificity of CD8(+) T cells against persistent or non-persistent viruses, and further define differentiation phenotypes of CD8(+) T cells by CD27 and CD28 expression. Surprisingly, the inhibitory receptor PD-1 was expressed by Flu-specific CD8(+) T cells in a level comparable to HCMV-and EBV-specific cells. Moreover, in virus-specific CD8(+) T cells, CD127(+)/CD127(-) and CD62L(+)/CD62L(-) cells expressed similar levels of PD-1 molecules. These results suggest that the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway may play a regulatory role in memory T cell subsets in addition to its association with T-cell exhaustion.
17942413	eggNOG: automated construction and annotation of orthologous groups of genes.	The identification of orthologous genes forms the basis for most comparative genomics studies. Existing approaches either lack functional annotation of the identified orthologous groups, hampering the interpretation of subsequent results, or are manually annotated and thus lag behind the rapid sequencing of new genomes. Here we present the eggNOG database ('evolutionary genealogy of genes: Non-supervised Orthologous Groups'), which contains orthologous groups constructed from Smith-Waterman alignments through identification of reciprocal best matches and triangular linkage clustering. Applying this procedure to 312 bacterial, 26 archaeal and 35 eukaryotic genomes yielded 43 582 course-grained orthologous groups of which 9724 are extended versions of those from the original COG/KOG database. We also constructed more fine-grained groups for selected subsets of organisms, such as the 19 914 mammalian orthologous groups. We automatically annotated our non-supervised orthologous groups with functional descriptions, which were derived by identifying common denominators for the genes based on their individual textual descriptions, annotated functional categories, and predicted protein domains. The orthologous groups in eggNOG contain 1 241 751 genes and provide at least a broad functional description for 77% of them. Users can query the resource for individual genes via a web interface or download the complete set of orthologous groups at http://eggnog.embl.de.
17942431	Bacteriome.org--an integrated protein interaction database for E. coli.	High throughput methods are increasingly being used to examine the functions and interactions of gene products on a genome-scale. These include systematic large-scale proteomic studies of protein complexes and protein-protein interaction networks, functional genomic studies examining patterns of gene expression and comparative genomics studies examining patterns of conservation. Since these datasets offer different yet highly complementary perspectives on cell behavior it is expected that integration of these datasets will lead to conceptual advances in our understanding of the fundamental design and evolutionary principles that underlie the organization and function of proteins within biochemical pathways. Here we present Bacteriome.org, a resource that combines locally generated interaction and evolutionary datasets with a previously generated knowledgebase, to provide an integrated view of the Escherichia coli interactome. Tools are provided which allow the user to select and visualize functional, evolutionary and structural relationships between groups of interacting proteins and to focus on genes of interest. Currently the database contains three interaction datasets: a functional dataset consisting of 3989 interactions between 1927 proteins; a 'core' high quality experimental dataset of 4863 interactions between 1100 proteins and an 'extended' experimental dataset of 9860 interactions between 2131 proteins. Bacteriome.org is available online at http://www.bacteriome.org.
17942558	Crystal structure of the NS3 protease-helicase from dengue virus.	Several flaviviruses are important human pathogens, including dengue virus, a disease against which neither a vaccine nor specific antiviral therapies currently exist. During infection, the flavivirus RNA genome is translated into a polyprotein, which is cleaved into several components. Nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) carries out enzymatic reactions essential for viral replication, including proteolysis of the polyprotein through its serine protease N-terminal domain, with a segment of 40 residues from the NS2B protein acting as a cofactor. The ATPase/helicase domain is located at the C terminus of NS3. Atomic structures are available for these domains separately, but a molecular view of the full-length flavivirus NS3 polypeptide is still lacking. We report a crystallographic structure of a complete NS3 molecule fused to 18 residues of the NS2B cofactor at a resolution of 3.15 A. The relative orientation between the protease and helicase domains is drastically different than the single-chain NS3-NS4A molecule from hepatitis C virus, which was caught in the act of cis cleavage at the NS3-NS4A junction. Here, the protease domain sits beneath the ATP binding site, giving the molecule an elongated shape. The domain arrangement found in the crystal structure fits nicely into an envelope determined ab initio using small-angle X-ray scattering experiments in solution, suggesting a stable molecular conformation. We propose that a basic patch located at the surface of the protease domain increases the affinity for nucleotides and could also participate in RNA binding, explaining the higher unwinding activity of the full-length enzyme compared to that of the isolated helicase domain.
17942636	Intestinal Ca2+ wave dynamics in freely moving C. elegans coordinate execution of a rhythmic motor program.	Defecation in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans is a highly rhythmic behavior that is regulated by a Ca(2+) wave generated in the 20 epithelial cells of the intestine, in part through activation of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor. Execution of the defecation motor program (DMP) can be modified by external cues such as nutrient availability or mechanical stimulation. To address the likelihood that environmental regulation of the DMP requires integrating distinct cellular and organismal processes, we have developed a method for studying coordinate Ca(2+) oscillations and defecation behavior in intact, freely behaving animals. We tested this technique by examining how mutations in genes known to alter Ca(2+) handling [including egl-8/phospholipase C (PLC)-beta, kqt-3/KCNQ1, sca-1/sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase, and unc-43/Ca(2+)-CaMKII] contribute to shaping the Ca(2+) wave and asked how Ca(2+) wave dynamics in the mutant backgrounds altered execution of the DMP. Notably, we find that Ca(2+) waves in the absence of PLCbeta initiate ectopically, often traveling in reverse, and fail to trigger a complete DMP. These results suggest that the normal supremacy of the posterior intestinal cells is not obligatory for Ca(2+) wave occurrence but instead helps to coordinate the DMP. Furthermore, we present evidence suggesting that an underlying pacemaker appears to oscillate at a faster frequency than the defecation cycle and that arrhythmia may result from uncoupling the pacemaker from the DMP rather than from disrupting the pacemaker itself. We also show that chronic elevations in Ca(2+) have limited influence on the defecation period but instead alter the interval between successive steps of the DMP. Finally, our results demonstrate that it is possible to assess Ca(2+) dynamics and muscular contractions in a completely unrestrained model organism.
17942754	TACI, unlike BAFF-R, is solely activated by oligomeric BAFF and APRIL to support survival of activated B cells and plasmablasts.	The cytokine BAFF binds to the receptors TACI, BCMA, and BAFF-R on B cells, whereas APRIL binds to TACI and BCMA only. The signaling properties of soluble trimeric BAFF (BAFF 3-mer) were compared with those of higher-order BAFF oligomers. All forms of BAFF bound BAFF-R and TACI, and elicited BAFF-R-dependent signals in primary B cells. In contrast, signaling through TACI in mature B cells or plasmablasts was only achieved by higher-order BAFF and APRIL oligomers, all of which were also po-tent activators of a multimerization-dependent reporter signaling pathway. These results indicate that, although BAFF-R and TACI can provide B cells with similar signals, only BAFF-R, but not TACI, can respond to soluble BAFF 3-mer, which is the main form of BAFF found in circulation. BAFF 60-mer, an efficient TACI agonist, was also detected in plasma of BAFF transgenic and nontransgenic mice and was more than 100-fold more active than BAFF 3-mer for the activation of multimerization-dependent signals. TACI supported survival of activated B cells and plasmablasts in vitro, providing a rational basis to explain the immunoglobulin deficiency reported in TACI-deficient persons.
17943147	Cardio-specific long-term gene expression in a porcine model after selective pressure-regulated retroinfusion of adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors.	Cornerstone for an efficient cardiac gene therapy is the need for a vector system, which enables selective and long-term expression of the gene of interest. In rodent animal models adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors like AAV-6 have been shown to efficiently transduce cardiomyocytes. However, since significant species-dependent differences in transduction characteristics exist, large animal models are of imminent need for preclinical evaluations. We compared gene transfer efficiencies of AAV-6 and heparin binding site-deleted AAV-2 vectors in a porcine model. Application of the AAVs was performed by pressure-regulated retroinfusion of the anterior interventricular cardiac vein, which has been previously shown to efficiently deliver genes to the myocardium (3.5 x 10(10) viral genomes per animal; n=5 animals per group). All vectors harbored a luciferase reporter gene under control of a cytomegalovirus (CMV)-enhanced 1.5 kb rat myosin light chain promoter (CMV-MLC2v). Expression levels were evaluated 4 weeks after gene transfer by determining luciferase activities. To rule out a systemic spillover peripheral tissue was analyzed by PCR for the presence of vector genomes. Selective retroinfusion of AAV serotype 6 vectors into the anterior cardiac vein substantially increased reporter gene expression in the targeted distal left anterior descending (LAD) territory (65 943+/-31 122 vs control territory 294+/-69, P<0.05). Retroinfusion of AAV-2 vectors showed lower transgene expression, which could be increased with coadministration of recombinant human vascular endothelial growth factor (1365+/-707 no vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) vs 38 760+/-2448 with VEGF, P<0.05). Significant transgene expression was not detected in other organs than the heart, although vector genomes were detected also in the lung and liver. Thus, selective retroinfusion of AAV-6 into the coronary vein led to efficient long-term myocardial reporter gene expression in the targeted LAD area of the porcine heart. Coapplication of VEGF significantly increased transduction efficiency of AAV-2.
17943178	Human skin keloid fibroblasts display bioenergetics of cancer cells.	Cultured human skin keloid fibroblasts (KFs) showed bioenergetics similar to cancer cells in generating ATP mainly from glycolysis as demonstrated by increased lactate production. Activities of hexokinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and lactate dehydrogenase were also significantly higher compared with normal fibroblasts (NFs). Inhibitors of glycolysis decreased the rate of ATP biosynthesis more significantly in KFs suggesting their reliance on glycolysis. In contrast, ATP generation in NFs was derived mainly from oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), which was more compromised by mitochondrial/respiratory inhibitors. However, when fortified with excess exogenous respiratory substrates, ATP production was increased to a similar maximal level in both types of fibroblasts. In spite of this seemingly equal total capacity, ATP biosynthesis and intracellular ATP concentration were significantly higher in KFs, which further increased their ATP production when exposed to hypoxia and hypoxia-mimetics: desferrioxamine and cobalt chloride. This upregulation was again significantly compromised by glycolytic inhibitors. The rate of generation of reactive oxygen species was lower in KFs possibly due to their switch to aerobic glycolysis from mitochondrial OXPHOS. Thus, cultured skin KFs could provide a human cell model to study the de-regulation of bioenergetics of proliferative cells and their response to the HIF (hypoxia-inducible factor) signaling.
17943272	After-hours admissions are not associated with increased risk-adjusted mortality in pediatric intensive care.	OBJECTIVE: To examine the influence of time of admission on risk-adjusted mortality and length of stay for nonelective patients admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) without 24-h per day in-house intensivist coverage. DESIGN: Data analyzed came from a comprehensive, prospectively collected ICU database. SETTING: A 12-bed pediatric ICU located in a university-affiliated tertiary referral children's hospital. PATIENTS: Subjects consisted of 4,456 consecutive nonelective patients admitted over a 10-year period (1997-2006). INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Patients were categorized according to time of admission to the ICU as either in-hours (0800-1800 Monday-Friday and 0800-1200 on weekends), when an intensivist is present in the ICU, or after-hours (all other times), when intensivists attend only on an as-needed basis. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the effect of time of admission on outcome after adjustment for severity of illness using the Paediatric Index of Mortality (PIM). Patients admitted after hours had a lower risk-adjusted mortality than those admitted during normal working hours, with an odds ratio for death of 0.712 (95% confidence interval 0.518-0.980, p = 0.037). Length of stay was also significantly shorter for patients admitted after hours (44.05h vs. 50.0h, p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A lack of in-house intensivist presence is not associated with any increase in mortality or length of stay for patients admitted to our pediatric ICU; on the contrary, after-hours admission in this cohort was associated with a decreased risk-adjusted mortality and a shorter length of stay.
17943719	MYCN regulates oncogenic MicroRNAs in neuroblastoma.	MYCN amplification is a common feature of aggressive tumour biology in neuroblastoma. The MYCN transcription factor has been demonstrated to induce or repress expression of numerous genes. MicroRNAs (miRNA) are a recently discovered class of short RNAs that repress translation and promote mRNA degradation by sequence-specific interaction with mRNA. Here, we sought to analyse the role of MYCN in regulation of miRNA expression. Using a miRNA microarray containing 384 different miRNAs and a set of 160 miRNA real-time PCR assays to validate the microarray results, 7 miRNAs were identified that are induced by MYCN in vitro and are upregulated in primary neuroblastomas with MYCN amplification. Three of the seven miRNAs belong to the miR-106a and miR-17 clusters, which have previously been shown to be regulated by c-Myc. The miR-17-92 polycistron also acts as an oncogene in haematopoietic progenitor cells. We show here that miR-221 is also induced by MYCN in neuroblastoma. Previous studies have reported miR-221 to be overexpressed in several other cancer entities, but its regulation has never before been associated with Myc. We present evidence of miRNA dysregulation in neuroblastoma. Additionally, we report miRNA induction to be a new mechanism of gene expression downregulation by MYCN.
17944007	Medication use in nursing home residents with advanced dementia.	OBJECTIVE: To describe medication usage in nursing home residents with advanced dementia, to identify how this usage changed as patients advanced towards death, and to identify correlates of increased medication usage. METHODS: Prospective cohort study (CareAD) during which data on medication prescription were extracted from medical records at regular intervals using standardized extraction procedures. RESULTS: Patients (n=125) were prescribed a mean of 14.6 medications during the 6 months prior to study enrollment. In a subgroup of patients who died during the study (n=88), as the time of death approached, the total number of medications prescribed did not vary but the types of medications prescribed did change, with an increase in palliative medications such as opiate analgesics and a decrease in other medication classes such as antibiotics, anti-dementia agents, cardiovascular agents, and psychotropic agents, among others. In linear regression analyses, total medication prescription at study entry was associated with study site, antibiotic treatment, presence of cardiovascular disease, and treatment of gastrointestinal or dermatological conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Nursing home residents with advanced dementia are prescribed a large number of medications from numerous medication classes and prescribing patterns change over time. Further study is needed to determine the ideal approach to treating chronic medical problems at the end of life in this patient population.
17944808	Gene expression quantitative trait locus analysis of 16 000 barley genes reveals a complex pattern of genome-wide transcriptional regulation.	Transcript abundance from cRNA hybridizations to Affymetrix microarrays can be used for simultaneous marker development and genome-wide gene expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis of crops. We have previously shown that it is easily possible to use Affymetrix expression arrays to profile individuals from a segregating population to accurately identify robust polymorphic molecular genetic markers. We applied the method to identify more than 2000 genetic polymorphisms (transcript derived markers, TDMs) from an experiment involving two commercial varieties of barley (Hordeum vulgare; Steptoe and Morex) and their doubled-haploid progeny. With this set of TDMs, we constructed a genetic map and used it for the genome-wide eQTL analysis of about 16 000 genes in a relatively large population (n = 139). We identified 23 738 significant eQTLs at a genome-wide significance (P </= 0.05), affecting the expression of 12 987 genes. Over a third of these genes with expression variation have only one identified eQTL while the rest have two to six. A large proportion of the quantitatively controlled transcripts appear to be regulated by both cis and trans effects. More than half of the quantitatively controlled transcripts appear to be primarily regulated by cis eQTLs in this population. We show that although there appear to be eQTL hotspots many of these are in chromosomal regions of low recombination, such as genetic centromeres, and so have a high gene density per centimorgan. Some chromosomal regions have a significant excess of eQTL over the number expected from gene density, and many of these are biased towards eQTL for which the allele from one particular parent increases the expression level.
17944828	Dissociation and horizontal transmission of codispersing lichen symbionts in the genus Lepraria (Lecanorales: Stereocaulaceae).	Lichenized fungi of the genus Lepraria lack ascomata and conidiomata, and symbionts codisperse by soredia. Here, it is determined whether algal symbionts associated with Lepraria are monophyletic, and whether fungal and algal phylogenies are congruent, both of which are indicative of a long-term, continuous association between symbionts. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and part of the actin type I locus were sequenced from algae associated with Lepraria, and the fungal ITS and mitochondrial small subunit (mtSSU) were sequenced from fungal symbionts. Phylogenetic analyses tested for monophyly of algal symbionts and congruence between algal and fungal phylogenies. Algae associated with Lepraria were not monophyletic, and identical algae associated with different Lepraria individuals and species. Algal and fungal phylogenies were not congruent, suggesting a lack of strict codiversification. This study suggests that associations between symbionts are not strictly maintained over evolutionary time. The ability to switch partners may provide benefits similar to genetic recombination, which may have helped this lineage persist.
17944878	Neural precursors derived from human embryonic stem cells maintain long-term proliferation without losing the potential to differentiate into all three neural lineages, including dopaminergic neurons.	Human embryonic stem (hES) cells have the ability to renew themselves and differentiate into multiple cell types upon exposure to appropriate signals. In particular, the ability of hES cells to differentiate into defined neural lineages, such as neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes, is fundamental to developing cell-based therapies for neurodegenerative disorders and studying developmental mechanisms. However, the utilization of hES cells for basic and applied research is hampered by the lack of well-defined methods to maintain their self-renewal and direct their differentiation. Recently we reported that neural precursor (NP) cells derived from mouse ES cells maintained their potential to differentiate into dopaminergic (DA) neurons after significant expansion in vitro. We hypothesized that NP cells derived from hES cells (hES-NP) could also undergo the same in vitro expansion and differentiation. To test this hypothesis, we passaged hES-NP cells and analyzed their proliferative and developmental properties. We found that hES-NP cells can proliferate approximately 380 000-fold after in vitro expansion for 12 weeks and maintain their potential to generate Tuj1+ neurons, GFAP+ astrocytes, and O4+ oligodendrocytes as well as tyrosine hydroxylase-positive (TH+) DA neurons. Furthermore, TH+ neurons originating from hES-NP cells expressed other midbrain DA markers, including Nurr1, Pitx3, Engrail-1, and aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase, and released significant amounts of DA. In addition, hES-NP cells maintained their developmental potential through long-term storage (over 2 years) in liquid nitrogen and multiple freeze-thaw cycles. These results demonstrate that hES-NP cells have the ability to provide an expandable and unlimited human cell source that can develop into specific neuronal and glial subtypes.
17945247	Adsorption of lanthanides on mordenite from nitrate medium.	The adsorption of lanthanides (except for Pm) on mordenite was investigated under various solution conditions of nitrate ion concentrations ([NO*3]: 0.001-2 mol/dm3) and total lanthanide concentrations (0.0005 mol/dm3). Solutions of lanthanide nitrates were equilibrated with zeolite samples at 296 K. A concave tetrad effect was evident in the change of logK d values within the lanthanide series and an explanation by a comparison of covalence in Ln-O bonds existing in triple bond Al-O(1/3Ln)-Si species found in the zeolite phase and in Ln(H2O)3+x or Ln(NO3) n-3 n complexes formed in the aqueous phase is presented. The decreasing trend in C1 and C3 coefficients, which are the function of E1 and E3 Racah f-interelectron repulsion parameters, is evidence of the magnification of covalence in Ln-O bond in the series triple bond S-iO(1/3Ln)-Al triple bond <Ln(H2O)3+ x <Ln(NO3) n-3 n. The adsorption isotherms of the lanthanides, registered for total lanthanide nitrate concentrations (0.0001-0.001 mol/dm3), were found to be a Freundlich type. The obtained adsorption capacity K and adsorption intensity n parameters show odd-even changes in the lanthanide series, indicating the importance of covalence effects in the lanthanides adsorption mechanism. The mordenite samples loaded with lanthanide nitrates were investigated using diffusive reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFT), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) methods. Negative correlations between E=([Al]-[Na])/[Ln] and [Ln]/[Al], and negative correlations for [Ln] and [Na] on the zeolite surface, resulting from the interaction (ion exchange) of lanthanide ions with triple bond Si-O(Na)-Al triple bond and Si-OH-Al triple bond groups within the mordenite framework were found. DRIFT spectra showed the sensitivity of the framework vibration band T-O-T for Ln3+ ion interactions with negative oxygen of the mordenite structure.
17945442	Survivin protein expression in bovine follicular oocytes and their in vitro developmental competence.	This study examined the relationship between survivin expression and the stage of development of in vitro cultured bovine oocytes and embryos; and whether survivin expression is affected by the quality of cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCS) or the quality of pre-implantation embryos. A polyclonal antibody was prepared using recombinant bovine survivin protein. Expression of survivin mRNA and protein was analyzed by real-time quantitative RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry. In the first experiment, survivin mRNA expression was examined at developmental stages from germinal vesicle (GV) oocyte to blastocyst, it was significantly decreased after fertilization of matured oocytes (P<0.05), then increased slightly to the 8-cell stage followed by rapid increases at the morula and blastocyst stages (P<0.05). In the second experiment, the effect of oocyte quality on survivin protein, pro-apoptotic (bax, caspase-3) and anti-apoptotic (survivin, bax inhibitor) mRNA expression was examined. Survivin protein was more strongly expressed in good quality COCS than in poor quality COCS. The expression of the anti-apoptotic genes, survivin and bax inhibitor, was significantly higher (P<0.05) and that of the pro-apoptotic genes, bax and caspase-3, was significantly lower (P<0.05) in good compared to poor quality COCS. The developmental competence of good quality COCS (30.4% blastocysts) was significantly better than that of poor quality COCS. In the last experiment also, we confirmed that significantly higher expression of survivin and bax inhibitor genes and significantly lower expression of bax and caspase-3 genes was resulted in good quality blastocysts than in poor quality blastocysts (P<0.05). It was concluded that the expression of survivin was related to the quality of COCS, their developmental competence and the quality of in vitro produced blastocysts. Consequently, survivin may be a good candidate marker for embryo quality.
17945529	The influence of age, gender, lifestyle factors and sub-clinical neck pain on the cervical flexion-rotation test and cervical range of motion.	The flexion-rotation test (FRT) is commonly used when assessing cervicogenic headache. Additionally, active range of motion (AROM) is frequently used to evaluate impairment in neck pain. No studies have investigated the interaction of the FRT and AROM with age, gender, pain and lifestyle factors. The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of these factors on the FRT and cervical AROM. A group of 66 participants (aged 20-78) were studied, 28 experienced sub-clinical neck pain (recurrent neck pain or discomfort which has not received treatment from a healthcare professional) while 38 did not. Age, gender, lifestyle factors and sub-clinical neck pain were assessed using a questionnaire. Measurement of AROM was performed by two examiners blind to the results of the questionnaire. Multiple linear regression analysis found that 59% of the variance in the FRT was explained by the presence of sub-clinical pain and cervical lateral flexion measures. Secondly, 58-72% of the variance in active cervical ROM measures was influenced by factors including the FRT, gender and movements of the neck in other planes. This study found that lifestyle factors do not influence the cervical FRT and AROM.

The software runs on any Linux- or -UNIX based platform. The package is freely available for academic users and can be downloaded from http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/
17947328	UgMicroSatdb: database for mining microsatellites from unigenes.	Microsatellites, also known as simple sequence repeats (SSRs) or short tandem repeats (STRs), have extensively been exploited as molecular markers for diverse applications. Recently, their role in gene regulation and genome evolution has also been discussed widely. We have developed UgMicroSatdb (Unigene MicroSatellite database), a web-based relational database of microsatellites present in unigene sequences covering 80 genomes. UgMicroSatdb allows microsatellite search using multiple parameters like microsatellite type (simple perfect, compound perfect and imperfect), repeat unit length (mono- to hexa-nucleotide), repeat number, microsatellite length and repeat sequence class. Microsatellites can also be retrieved by specifying EST, cDNA, CDS identity or by using Gene Index, GenBank, UniGene IDs. The database also provides information about trinucleotide repeats encoding various amino acids. Such codon repeats can be searched by specifying characteristics of coded amino acids like charge (basic, acidic or neutral), polarity (polar or non-polar), and their hydrophobic or hydrophilic nature. The nucleotide sequences of the target UniGenes are also provided to facilitate primer designing for PCR amplification of the desired microsatellite. UgMicroSatdb is available at http://ipu.ac.in/usbt/UgMicroSatdb.htm.
17947329	ppdb: a plant promoter database.	ppdb (http://www.ppdb.gene.nagoya-u.ac.jp) is a plant promoter database that provides promoter annotation of Arabidopsis and rice. The database contains information on promoter structures, transcription start sites (TSSs) that have been identified from full-length cDNA clones and also a vast amount of TSS tag data. In ppdb, the promoter structures are determined by sets of promoter elements identified by a position-sensitive extraction method called local distribution of short sequences (LDSS). By using this database, the core promoter structure, the presence of regulatory elements and the distribution of TSS clusters can be identified. Although no differentiation of promoter architecture among plant species has been reported, there is some divergence of utilized sequences for promoter elements. Therefore, ppdb is based on species-specific sets of promoter elements, rather than on general motifs for multiple species. Each regulatory sequence is hyperlinked to literary information, a PLACE entry served by a plant cis-element database, and a list of promoters containing the regulatory sequence.
17947331	CFGP: a web-based, comparative fungal genomics platform.	Since the completion of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome sequencing project in 1996, the genomes of over 80 fungal species have been sequenced or are currently being sequenced. Resulting data provide opportunities for studying and comparing fungal biology and evolution at the genome level. To support such studies, the Comparative Fungal Genomics Platform (CFGP; http://cfgp.snu.ac.kr), a web-based multifunctional informatics workbench, was developed. The CFGP comprises three layers, including the basal layer, middleware and the user interface. The data warehouse in the basal layer contains standardized genome sequences of 65 fungal species. The middleware processes queries via six analysis tools, including BLAST, ClustalW, InterProScan, SignalP 3.0, PSORT II and a newly developed tool named BLASTMatrix. The BLASTMatrix permits the identification and visualization of genes homologous to a query across multiple species. The Data-driven User Interface (DUI) of the CFGP was built on a new concept of pre-collecting data and post-executing analysis instead of the 'fill-in-the-form-and-press-SUBMIT' user interfaces utilized by most bioinformatics sites. A tool termed Favorite, which supports the management of encapsulated sequence data and provides a personalized data repository to users, is another novel feature in the DUI.
17948302	Effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy on circumferential margin positivity and its impact on prognosis in patients with resectable oesophageal cancer.	BACKGROUND: The significance of circumferential resection margin (CRM) involvement in oesophageal cancer surgery is controversial. This study investigated the relationship between CRM involvement, locoregional recurrence and survival, after surgery alone or with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. METHODS: Patients operated on by one surgeon at a tertiary referral centre between October 1997 and May 2004 were identified from a prospective database. RESULTS: Some 242 patients underwent oesophagectomy; 91 had surgery alone, 142 had neoadjuvant chemotherapy and nine neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Among patients with histologically confirmed T3 tumours, 26 (55 per cent) of 47 who underwent surgery alone had CRM involvement, compared with 27 (31 per cent) of 88 patients who completed two cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (P = 0.005). Thirty-seven (42 per cent) of 89 patients with a negative CRM developed locoregional recurrence, compared with 33 (59 per cent) of 56 with a positive margin (P = 0.032); median survival was 28 and 12 months respectively (P < 0.001). Cox multivariable regression analysis identified CRM involvement as an independent prognostic factor (P = 0.006). CONCLUSION: A positive CRM is an independent predictor of overall survival after oesophageal cancer resection. There has been a significant decrease in CRM involvement with the introduction of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
17949455	Patients with hyperhidrosis have changed grip force, coefficient of friction and safety margin.	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether subjects with palmar hyperhidrosis have functional problems with the handgrip caused by the wet slippery surface of palm and fingertips. We used two different dosages of botulinum toxin to explore its impact on sweating and on muscle strength in the hand. METHOD: Using an object equipped with force sensors we measured the muscle strength and calculated the coefficients of friction and safety margin (SM) in the precision grip before and 2, 4, 6, 8 10-12 weeks and 6 months after treatment of 13 patients with two different doses of botulinum toxin. Sweat evaporation was measured simultaneously. RESULTS: A significant decrease in evaporation and a parallel reduction of grip force in the dominant hand of the patients were observed. The SM used by the patients was significantly lower after the treatment, and increased gradually when sweating reappeared. CONCLUSION: These measurements showed, for the first time, that hyperhidrosis of the palms may cause an objective perturbation of the hand function which may be partially corrected by botulinum toxin treatment.
17949715	In vivo alpha-synuclein overexpression in rodents: a useful model of Parkinson's disease?	Mutations in alpha-synuclein were the first genetic defect linked to Parkinson's disease (PD). The relevance of alpha-synuclein to sporadic PD is strongly supported by the presence of alpha-synuclein aggregates in neurons of patients. This has prompted the development of numerous animal models based on alpha-synuclein overexpression, primarily through genetic methods in mice and viral transduction in rats. In mice, different promoters and transgenes lead to a wide variety of phenotypes accompanied by non-existent, late onset, or non-specific neurodegeneration. Rapid neurodegeneration, in contrast, is observed after viral transduction but is limited to the targeted region and does not mimic the broad pathology observed in the disease. Overall, each model reproduces a subset of features of PD and can be used to identify therapeutic targets and test disease-modifying therapies. The predictive value of all models of the disease, however, remains speculative in the absence of effective neuroprotective treatments for PD in humans.
17949737	Consonants in Cri du chat syndrome: a case study.	This article reports on a longitudinal case study of consonant productions in one Norwegian girl with Cri du chat syndrome from age 4;6 to age 9;4. It was shown that she had many articulation errors throughout the period of observation. Furthermore, these errors were shown to fall into three main categories: (1) errors of differentiation and tuning, (2) errors of coordination and sequencing, and (3) missing gestures. Also, omissions of segments were reported to be frequent. In sum, the consonant productions by this girl were found to be both delayed and deviant, as compared to normally developing children. The number of errors, however, decreased as she grew older, resulting in more accurate renditions of the target words.
17949773	A model for transport of membrane-associated phototransduction polypeptides in rod and cone photoreceptor inner segments.	We discuss putative mechanisms of membrane protein transport in photoreceptors based on Pde6d and Gucy2e/Gucy2f knockout mice. Knockout of the Pde6d gene encoding PrBP/delta, a prenyl binding protein present in the retina at relatively high levels, was shown to impair transport of G-protein coupled receptor kinase 1 (GRK1) and cone phosphodiesterase alpha' subunit (PDE6alpha') to the rod and cone outer segments. Other prenylated proteins are minimally affected, suggesting some specificity of interaction. Knockout of the Gucy2e gene encoding guanylate cyclase 1 (GC1) disrupted transport of G-protein coupled receptor kinase 1 (GRK1), cone PDE6alpha', cone transducin alpha and gamma subunits (cTalpha and cTgamma) to the cone outer segments, while a GC1/GC2 double knockout prevented transport of rod PDE6, but not transducin, GRK1, or rhodopsin, to the rod outer segments. These knockout phenotypes suggest that PrBP/delta functions in extracting prenylated proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where they dock after prenylation, and that GC-bearing membranes may co-transport peripheral membrane proteins in vesicles. We conclude that distinct pathways have evolved in rods and cones for transport of integral and peripherally membrane-associated proteins.
17949797	Laparoscopic surgery for large benign ovarian cysts.	OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility and surgical outcome of laparoscopic surgery among women with large benign ovarian cysts. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study applying laparoscopic surgery among women with ovarian cysts whose maximum diameter was > or = 10 cm and radiologic and laboratory features suggestive of benign disease. Patients' demographics, clinical and ultrasound features, CA-125 values, surgical procedures, operative and post-operative complications, estimated amount of blood loss (EBL), operative time, conversion to laparotomy and the pathologic findings were recorded. RESULTS: Thirty-three consecutive patients underwent laparoscopic surgery over 7 years. The mean (range) age and body mass index were 45.2 (17-73 years) and 30 (21-42), respectively. Laparoscopic surgery was successful in 31 (93.9%) patients. The procedure was converted to laparotomy in 2 patients secondary to adhesions. There were no operative or post-operative complications. The mean (range) operative time, EBL and hospital stay were 82 (45-125 min), 89 (20-250 mL) and 0.94 (0-4 days), respectively. Twenty-three (70%) patients were discharged home the day of the surgery. The surgical procedures performed were: unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (SO) (n=16), bilateral SO (n=4), ovarian cystectomy (n=2) and laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy and bilateral SO (n=9). The cysts were extracted after aspiration through the vagina (n=11), lower quadrant incision (n=5) or the umbilical incision (n=15). Pathologic findings included serous cystadenoma (n=11), mucinous cystadenoma (n=6), dermoid (n=6), endometriosis (n=5), benign epithelial-lined cyst (n=3) and borderline ovarian tumors (n=2). CONCLUSION: Laparoscopy is feasible and safe for women with large ovarian cysts with benign features and results in a short hospital stay.
17950008	A dual activation mechanism for Myb-responsive genes in myelomonocytic cells.	The retroviral oncogene v-myb encodes a transcription factor (v-Myb) which is responsible for the transformation of myelomonocytic cells by avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV). v-Myb is thought to exert its biological effects by deregulating the expression of specific target genes. Here we have used DNaseI hypersensitive site mapping and reporter gene assays to study the activation of three Myb target genes--mim-1, the lysozyme gene and the C/EBPbeta gene--all of which are activated by Myb in myelomonocytic cells but not in other hematopoietic lineages. We have found that these genes are activated by Myb via more than one cis-regulatory region. Our data suggest that all three genes are activated by Myb by dual mechanisms involving the promoters as well as enhancers. Using a cell line that expresses an estrogen-inducible v-Myb/estrogen receptor fusion protein we have also determined the effect of Myb on the expression of the C/EBPalpha gene. Our results show that C/EBPalpha expression is down-regulated by v-Myb. Thus, v-Myb affects the expression of two C/EBP family members in opposite directions.
17950026	The nitroxide antioxidant Tempol affects metal-induced cyto- and genotoxicity in human lymphocytes in vitro.	Stable, membrane-permeating nitroxide radicals have been reported to possess antioxidant activity in various experimental systems while, in parallel, they have been considered to be evidently harmful oxidants. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of the piperidine nitroxide 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (Tempol) in the modulation of cyto- and genotoxicity in human lymphocytes in vitro by cadmium and chromium, which depend, at least in part, on formation of reactive oxygen species. The cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay to measure micronucleus (MN) formation, the nuclear division index (NDI) and the percentage of apoptotic and necrotic cells were assessed after exposure human lymphocytes to Cd(II), Cr(III) and Cr(VI) or co-incubation with these metals and Tempol. We found a significant ability of 5-50 microM Tempol to diminish toxic effects of the agents tested. In every system studied, Tempol decreased the micronucleus frequency and the percentage of apoptotic and necrotic cells, while it increased the nuclear division index (p<0.05). We observed adverse effects when 0.1-1 mM Tempol alone was used: inhibition of cell growth, induction of apoptotic and necrotic cell death and chromosomal damage (p<0.05). Collectively, we demonstrated that Tempol can be considered as a potent anti-apoptotic and antigenotoxic agent, but also as a cytotoxic and clastogenic chemical, depending on the concentration applied.
17950548	The use of Megaselia abdita (Diptera: Phoridae) in forensic entomology.	This case study demonstrates the importance of the Phorid, Megaselia abdita (Schmitz), as an indicator for post-mortem interval estimation in criminal investigations involving forensic entomology where it is usually the more frequently occurring Calliphorids that are most useful. A case example is discussed where the temperatures were low for the period of time the deceased was missing.
17950608	Discovery and structure-activity relationship of N-phenyl-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-b]quinolin-4-amines as a new series of potent apoptosis inducers.	We report the discovery and SAR study of a series of N-phenyl-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-b]quinolin-4-amines as potent inducers of apoptosis. N-(3-Acetylphenyl)-2,3-dihydro-1H-cyclopenta[b]quinolin-9-amine (2) was discovered through our cell- and caspase-based HTS assays as an inducer of apoptosis. Compound 2 is active against cancer cells derived from several human solid tumors, with EC(50) values ranging from 400 to 700 nM. SAR study of hit 2 led to the discovery of N-phenyl-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-b]quinolin-4-amines as a novel series of potent apoptosis inducers, with 1,3-dimethyl-N-(4-propionylphenyl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-b]quinolin-amine (6b) having EC(50) values ranging from 30 to 70 nM in cancer cells. These compounds also demonstrated potent activity in the cell growth inhibition assay, with GI(50) values of 16-42 nM for compound 6b.
17950625	Dissociated responses in the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex to bottom-up and top-down components of emotional evaluation.	Although emotional responses to stimuli may be automatic, explicit evaluation of emotion is a voluntary act. These bottom-up and top-down processes may be supported by distinct neural systems. Previous studies reported bottom-up responses in the amygdala, top-down responses in the orbital and ventromedial prefrontal cortices, and top-down modulation of the amygdalar response. The current study used event-related fMRI on fifteen healthy males to examine these responses in the absence of stimulus anticipation or task repetition. Factorial analysis distinguished bottom-up responses in the amygdala from top-down responses in the orbitofrontal cortex. Activation of ventromedial prefrontal cortex and modulation of amygdalar response were not observed, and future studies may investigate whether these effects are contingent upon anticipation or cognitive set.
17950626	Activities in the frontal cortex and gait performance are modulated by preparation. An fNIRS study.	Neural activities in the primary motor cortex and supplementary motor area increase during the preparation as well as execution of voluntary movements of the hand and foot. However, there are few studies concerning preparatory activities of the brain preceding walking performance. We investigated how a verbal instruction "ready" before walking affected cortical activations and walking performances using a functional near-infrared spectroscopy. Seven healthy subjects performed two locomotor tasks on a treadmill with a verbal instruction "ready" before the treadmill was started (prepared walking; PW) and without it (simple walking; SW). Cadence was smaller and stride length was longer in PW than in SW. Increases of oxygenated hemoglobin (oxyHb) in the frontal regions especially in the prefrontal and premotor cortices were greater in PW than in SW both during the preparation and walking periods. These results suggested that preparation for walking cued by a verbal instruction enhanced frontal activations both during the preparation and execution of walking as well as walking performance.
17951096	Postero-anterior movements of the cervical spine: repeatability of force displacement curves.	The repeatability of instrumented assessments of postero-anterior (PA) movements has been reported previously for lumbar and thoracic spines, but only in relation to limited parameters of the movement. This study describes a device for measuring PA movements of the cervical spine and reports on repeatability of the entire force/displacement (FD) curves. Repeatability was assessed using coefficients of multiple determination (CMDs) and adjusted CMDs (where the mean offset between the two curves are removed and the shape of the curve can be more directly assessed) for inter-rater intra-day (inter-rater), intra-rater inter-day (inter-day) and intra-rater intra-day (intra-rater) repeated measurements. The mean CMD and mean adjusted CMD for intra-rater measurements (0.90 and 0.99, respectively) were significantly higher than for the other measurement intervals. Inter-rater and inter-day mean CMDs were 0.76 and 0.73 and mean adjusted CMDs were 0.96 and 0.97. It is concluded that the maximum repeatability is achieved if the same operator reassesses the patient on the same day. It is hoped that the methodology described will form the basis for further research that will enable greater understanding of what characteristics of PA movements inform manual palpation and thereby enable improvement in both manual therapy treatment teaching efficiency of manual therapy skills.
17951220	Human embryonic stem cell-derived dopaminergic neurons reverse functional deficit in parkinsonian rats.	We show that human embryonic stem cell-derived dopaminergic neurons survived transplantation to the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rat striatum and, in combination with the cells newly differentiated from their progenitors, contributed to locomotive function recovery at 5 months. The animal behavioral improvement was correlated with the dopamine neurons present in the graft. Although the donor cells contained forebrain and midbrain dopamine neurons, the dopamine neurons present in the graft mainly exhibited a midbrain, or nigra, phenotype, suggesting the importance of midbrain dopamine neurons in functional repair. Furthermore, progenies of grafted cells were neurons and glia with greatly diminished mitotic activity by 5 months. Thus, the in vitro-produced human dopamine neurons can functionally engraft in the brain.
17951298	Coupled feedback loops form dynamic motifs of cellular networks.	Cellular networks are composed of complicated interconnections among components, and some subnetworks of particular functioning are often identified as network motifs. Among such network motifs, feedback loops are thought to play important dynamical roles. Intriguingly, such feedback loops are very often found as a coupled structure in cellular circuits. Therefore, we integrated all the scattered information regarding the coupled feedbacks in various cellular circuits and investigated the dynamical role of each coupled structure. Finally, we discovered that coupled positive feedbacks enhance signal amplification and bistable characteristics; coupled negative feedbacks realize enhanced homeostasis; coupled positive and negative feedbacks enable reliable decision-making by properly modulating signal responses and effectively dealing with noise.
17951299	The Bacillus subtilis RNA helicase YxiN is distended in solution.	The Bacillus subtilis YxiN protein is a modular three-domain RNA helicase of the DEx(D/H)-box protein family. The first two domains form the highly conserved helicase core, and the third domain confers RNA target binding specificity. Small angle x-ray scattering on YxiN and two-domain fragments thereof shows that the protein has a distended structure in solution, in contrast to helicases involved in replication processes. These data are consistent with a chaperone activity in which the carboxy-terminal domain of YxiN tethers the protein to the vicinity of its targets and the helicase core is free to transiently interact with RNA duplexes, possibly to melt out misfolded elements of secondary structure.
17951374	A tetraantennary glycan with bisecting N-acetylglucosamine and the Sd(a) antigen is the predominant N-glycan on bovine pregnancy-associated glycoproteins.	Pregnancy-associated glycoproteins (PAGs) are major secretory proteins of trophoblast cells in ruminants. Binucleate trophoblast giant cells (BNCs) store these proteins in secretory granules and release them into the maternal organism after fusion with maternal uterine epithelial cells. By matrix assisted laser desorption ionisation-mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) analysis and linkage analysis, we show that by far, the most abundant N-glycan of PAGs in midpregnancy is a tetraantennary core-fucosylated structure with a bisecting N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc). All four antennae consist of the Sd(a)-antigen (NeuAcalpha2-3[GalNAcbeta1-4]Galbeta1-4GlcNAc-). Immunohistochemistry with the mono- clonal antibody CT1, which recognizes the Sd(a)-antigen, shows that BNC granules contain the Sd(a)-antigen from gestation day (gd) 32 until a few days before parturition. Lectin histochemistry with Maackia amurensis lectin (MAL), which binds to alpha2-3sialylated lactosamine, shows that BNC granules are MAL-positive prior to gd 32 and also at parturition. The observed tetraantennary glycan is a highly unusual structure, since during the synthesis of N-glycans, the insertion of a bisecting GlcNAc inhibits the activity of the GlcNAc-transferases that leads to tri- and tetraantennary glycans. The study defines the substantial changes of PAG N-glycosylation in the course of pregnancy. This promotes the hypothesis that PAGs may have different carbohydrate-mediated functions at different stages of pregnancy.
17951380	Genome sequence of Staphylococcus aureus strain Newman and comparative analysis of staphylococcal genomes: polymorphism and evolution of two major pathogenicity islands.	Strains of Staphylococcus aureus, an important human pathogen, display up to 20% variability in their genome sequence, and most sequence information is available for human clinical isolates that have not been subjected to genetic analysis of virulence attributes. S. aureus strain Newman, which was also isolated from a human infection, displays robust virulence properties in animal models of disease and has already been extensively analyzed for its molecular traits of staphylococcal pathogenesis. We report here the complete genome sequence of S. aureus Newman, which carries four integrated prophages, as well as two large pathogenicity islands. In agreement with the view that S. aureus Newman prophages contribute important properties to pathogenesis, fewer virulence factors are found outside of the prophages than for the highly virulent strain MW2. The absence of drug resistance genes reflects the general antibiotic-susceptible phenotype of S. aureus Newman. Phylogenetic analyses reveal clonal relationships between the staphylococcal strains Newman, COL, NCTC8325, and USA300 and a greater evolutionary distance to strains MRSA252, MW2, MSSA476, N315, Mu50, JH1, JH9, and RF122. However, polymorphism analysis of two large pathogenicity islands distributed among these strains shows that the two islands were acquired independently from the evolutionary pathway of the chromosomal backbones of staphylococcal genomes. Prophages and pathogenicity islands play central roles in S. aureus virulence and evolution.
17951382	Role of RelA of Streptococcus mutans in global control of gene expression.	The production of (p)ppGpp by Streptococcus mutans UA159 is catalyzed by three gene products: RelA, RelP, and RelQ. Here, we investigate the role of the RelA (Rel) homologue of S. mutans in the stringent response and in the global control of gene expression. RelA of S. mutans was shown to synthesize pppGpp in vitro from GTP and ATP in the absence of added ribosomes, as well as in vivo in an Escherichia coli relA-spoT mutant. Mupirocin (MUP) was shown to induce high levels of (p)ppGpp production in S. mutans in a relA-dependent manner, with a concomitant reduction in GTP pools. Transcription profiling after MUP treatment of S. mutans revealed that 104 genes were upregulated and 130 were downregulated (P < or = 0.001); mainly, genes for macromolecular biosynthesis, translation, and energy metabolism were downregulated. When a derivative of UA159 carrying a complete deletion of the relA gene was treated with MUP, 72 genes were upregulated and 52 were downregulated (P < or = 0.001). The expression of 50 genes (P < or = 0.001) was commonly affected by MUP treatment in the two strains, suggesting that S. mutans can mount a relA-independent response to MUP. Consistent with the gene expression profiling, RelA was shown to play major roles in the regulation of phenotypic traits that are required for establishment, persistence, and virulence expression by this oral pathogen. Thus, RelA is the major (p)ppGpp synthase controlling the stringent response in S. mutans, and it coordinates the expression of genes and phenotypes that contribute to the pathogenic potential of the organism.
17952398	Behavioral and faunal implications of Early Cretaceous deinonychosaur trackways from China.	Deinonychosaurian theropods, the dinosaurian sister group of birds, are characterized by a large raptorial claw borne on a highly modified second digit that was thought to be held in a retracted position during locomotion. In this study, we present new trackway evidence for two coeval deinonychosaurian taxa from the Early Cretaceous of Shandong, China that indicate a hitherto unrecognized body size diversity for this period and continent. These fossil tracks confirm diversity and locomotory patterns implied by phylogeny and biogeography, but not yet manifested in the body fossil record. Multiple parallel and closely spaced trackways generated by the larger track maker provide the best evidence yet discovered for gregarious behavior in deinonychosaurian theropods.
17952757	Exposure to heterocyclic aromatic amines from the consumption of cooked red meat and its effect on human cancer risk: a review.	This review covers the bibliographic data from the last 10 years on the possible carcinogenicity of heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs) in humans. Aspects such as red meat intake, cooking methods applied to red meat, and doneness of cooking are discussed from an epidemiological point of view. The role in the carcinogenicity of the HAAs has been assigned to two main factors: first, the very high frequency of consumption of red meat; and, second, very darkly browned meats from cooking. However, there are some uncertainties associated with epidemiological results such as the presence of other carcinogens, co-carcinogens and anti-carcinogens in the diet, analytical results on the content of HAAs in foods, food frequency questionnaires, and mainly genetic susceptibility to HAAs. It is concluded that there is not sufficient scientific evidence to support the hypothesis that human cancer risk is due specifically to the intake of HAAs in the diet.
17954009	Chronic paroxysmal hemicrania and hemicrania continua responding to topiramate: two case reports.	Chronic paroxysmal hemicrania (CPH) is a rare primary headache syndrome, which is classified along with cluster headache and short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection and tearing as a trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia (TACs). Hemicrania continua (HC) was previously classified as one of the TACs, but in the recent second classification of the International Headache Society this disorder was moved to the group of other primary headaches. Both CPH and HC are characterised by moderate to excruciating pain requiring pharmacological treatment; furthermore, both conditions are characterised by an absolute response to indomethacin, which represents one of the current diagnostic criteria for these two syndromes. Unfortunately, in about one-fourth of cases treatment with indomethacin may cause adverse events, mostly gastrointestinal. We report one subject with CPH and another with HC intolerant to indomethacin, who responded remarkably well to topiramate.
17954670	Food security, poverty, and human development in the United States.	Access to food is essential to optimal development and function in children and adults. Food security, food insecurity, and hunger have been defined and a U.S. Food Security Scale was developed and is administered annually by the Census Bureau in its Current Population Survey. The eight child-referenced items now make up a Children's Food Security Scale. This review summarizes the data on household and children's food insecurity and its relationship with children's health and development and with mothers' depressive symptoms. It is demonstrable that food insecurity is a prevalent risk to the growth, health, cognitive, and behavioral potential of America's poor and near-poor children. Infants and toddlers in particular are at risk from food insecurity even at the lowest levels of severity, and the data indicate an "invisible epidemic" of a serious condition. Food insecurity is readily measured and rapidly remediable through policy changes, which a country like the United States, unlike many others, is fully capable of implementing. The food and distribution resources exist; the only constraint is political will.
17954672	Psychological costs of growing up poor.	This chapter provides a synopsis of the extensive empirical and theoretical literatures on the psychological development of youth growing up poor. Low family income has statistically and practically significant costs for children's psychological development in cognitive and social-emotional domains, as shown by high rates of academic failure and mental health problems among youth growing up poor. These psychological costs are incurred primarily because poverty limits children's access to developmental stimulation and heightens their exposure to stress in both their physical and psychosocial environments. Yet, convergent evidence from experimental and nonexperimental studies also indicates that improving the economic well-being of poor families translates into improved psychological well-being for poor youth.
17954681	Poverty, gender inequities, and women's risk of human immunodeficiency virus/AIDS.	Entrenched economic and gender inequities together are driving a globally expanding, increasingly female, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS epidemic. To date, significant population-level declines in HIV transmission have not been observed, at least in part because most approaches to prevention have presumed a degree of individual control in decision making that does not speak to the reality of women's and girls' circumstances in many parts of the world. Such efforts have paid insufficient attention to critical characteristics of the risk environment, most notably poverty and gender power inequities. Even fewer interventions have addressed specific mechanisms through which these inequities engender risky sexual practices that result in women's disproportionately increased vulnerabilities to HIV infection. This article focuses on identifying those mechanisms, or structural pathways, that stem from the interactions between poverty and entrenched gender inequities and recommending strategies to address and potentially modify those pathways. We highlight four such structural pathways to HIV risk, all of which could be transformed: (1) lack of access to critical information and health services for HIV/sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention, (2) limited access to formal education and skill development, (3) intimate partner violence, and (4) the negative consequences of migration prompted by insufficient economic resources. We argue for interventions that enhance women's access to education, training, employment, and HIV/STI prevention information and tools; minimize migration; and by working with men and communities, at the same time reduce women's poverty and promote gender-equitable norms. In conclusion, we identify challenges in developing and evaluating strategies to address these structural pathways.
17955030	Effect of obesity on breathlessness and airway responsiveness to methacholine in non-asthmatic subjects.	BACKGROUND: Obesity is associated with increased prevalence and incidence of asthma, but the mechanism is unknown. Obesity reduces lung volumes, which can increase airway responsiveness, and increases resistive and elastic work of breathing, which can increase dyspnea. OBJECTIVE: To determine if the intensity of dyspnea due to airway narrowing or if airway responsiveness is increased in obese, non-asthmatic subjects. SUBJECTS: Twenty-three obese (BMI (body mass index) > or =30 kg m(-2)) and 26 non-obese (BMI <30 kg m(-2)) non-asthmatic subjects, aged between 18 and 70 years. METHODS: High-dose methacholine challenge was used to determine the sensitivity and the maximal response to methacholine. Respiratory system resistance (Rrs) and reactance were measured, using the forced oscillation technique, as indicators of resistive and elastic loads during challenge. Perception of dyspnea was measured by the Borg score during challenge. Static lung volumes were measured by body plethysmography. RESULTS: Static lung volumes were reduced in the obese subjects. There were no significant differences in the sensitivity or maximal response to methacholine between obese and non-obese subjects. The magnitude of change in Rrs was similar in both groups, but obese subjects had more negative reactance after challenge (P=0.002) indicating a greater elastic load. The intensity of dyspnea was greater in obese subjects (P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Obesity reduces lung volumes, but does not alter the sensitivity or maximal response to methacholine. However, obese subjects have enhanced perception of dyspnea, associated with greater apparent stiffness of the respiratory system, and may therefore be at greater risk of symptoms.
17955261	A genome-wide approach to identifying novel-imprinted genes.	Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic process in which the copy of a gene inherited from one parent (maternal or paternal) is consistently silenced or expressed at a significantly lower level than the copy from the other parent. In an effort to begin a systematic genome-wide screen for imprinted genes, we assayed differential allelic expression (DAE) at 3,877 bi-allelic protein-coding sites located in 2,625 human genes in 67 unrelated individuals using genotyping microarrays. We used the presence of both over- and under-expression of the reference allele compared to the alternate allele to identify candidate-imprinted genes. We found 61 genes with at least twofold DAE plus "flipping" of the more highly expressed allele between reference and alternate across heterozygous samples. Sixteen flipping genes were genotyped and assayed for DAE in an independent data set of lymphoblastoid cell lines from two CEPH pedigrees. We confirmed that PEG10 is paternally expressed, identified one gene (ZNF331) with multiple lines of data indicating it is imprinted, and predicted several additional imprinting candidate genes. Our findings suggest that there are at most several hundred genes in the human genome that are universally imprinted. With samples of mRNA from appropriate tissues and a collection of informative cSNPs, a genome-wide search using this methodology could expand the list of genes that undergo genomic imprinting in a tissue- or temporal-specific manner.
17955289	Use of retrievable compared to permanent inferior vena cava filters: a single-institution experience.	The purpose of this study was to review the use, safety, and efficacy of retrievable inferior vena cava (IVC) filters in their first 5 years of availability at our institution. Comparison was made with permanent filters placed in the same period. A retrospective review of IVC filter implantations was performed from September, 1999, to September, 2004, in our department. These included both retrievable and permanent filters. The Recovery nitinol and Günther tulip filters were used as retrievable filters. The frequency of retrievable filter used was calculated. Clinical data and technical data related to filter placement were reviewed. Outcomes, including pulmonary embolism, complications associated with placement, retrieval, or indwelling, were calculated. During the study period, 604 IVC filters were placed. Of these, 97 retrievable filters (16%) were placed in 96 patients. There were 53 Recovery filter and 44 Tulip filter insertions. Subjects were 59 women and 37 men; the mean age was 52 years, with a range of from 18 to 97 years. The placement of retrievable filters increased from 2% in year 1 to 32% in year 5 of the study period. The total implantation time for the permanent group was 145,450 days, with an average of 288 days (range, 33-1811 days). For the retrievable group, the total implantation time was 21,671 days, with an average of 226 days (range, 2-1217 days). Of 29 patients who returned for filter retrieval, the filter was successfully removed in 28. There were 14 of 14 successful Tulip filter retrievals and 14 of 15 successful Recovery filter retrievals. In one patient, after an indwelling period of 39 days, a Recovery nitinol filter could not be removed secondary to a large clot burden within the filter. For the filters that were removed, the mean dwell time was 50 days for the Tulip type and 20 days for the Recovery type. Over the follow-up period there was an overall PE incidence of 1.4% for the permanent group and 1% for the retrieval group. In conclusion, there was an increase in the use of retrievable filters over the study period and an overall increase in the total number of filters implanted. The increased use of these filters appeared to be due to expanded indications predicated by their retrievability. Placement and retrieval of these filters have a low risk of complications, and retrievable filters appeared effective, as there was low rate of clinically significant pulmonary embolism associated with these filters during their indwelling time.
17956651	Testing hierarchical levels of population sub-structuring: the Azores islands (Portugal) as a case study.	The Azores archipelago (Portugal) is formed by nine islands whose relative positions define them as three geographical groups: Eastern (S. Miguel and Sta. Maria), Central (Terceira, Faial, Pico, Graciosa and S. Jorge) and Western (Flores and Corvo). Using the father's surname of 187,398 individuals living on the nine Azorean Islands, a population analysis based on inter-island relationship and hierarchical organization was conducted. The relation between islands was investigated using summary statistics, analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) as well as graphical methods. When the values of heteronymy were contrasted with values of gene diversity based on haplogroup frequencies of the Y chromosome, it was possible to verify that Graciosa and Sta. Maria appeared to have the least diverse populations, and that Flores, despite its smaller population size and geographical isolation, has considerably higher levels of diversity. As for inter-island relationships, the difficulty of directly interpreting summary statistics values was evidenced. The AMOVA revealed that only 0.77% of the variation in surnames can be attributed to among-island variation, a value that, although small, can be considered significant. Application of Malécot's model revealed that geographic distance has an important impact in the genetic structure of the archipelago. Monmonier's maximum-difference algorithm demonstrated that the most isolated island of the archipelago appears to be Graciosa, followed by the islands of the Western group and by Sta. Maria. After integrating values of summary statistics with results from AMOVA and graphical methods, a more accurate genetic profile of the Azores, highly supported by genetic data, has emerged.
17956851	Maternal investment tactics in superb fairy-wrens.	In cooperatively breeding species, parents often use helper contributions to offspring care to cut their own costs of investment (i.e. load-lightening). Understanding the process of load-lightening is essential to understanding both the rules governing parental investment and the adaptive value of helping behaviour, but little experimental work has been conducted. Here we report the results of field experiments to determine maternal provisioning rules in cooperatively breeding superb fairy-wrens (Malurus cyaneus). By manipulating carer: offspring ratios, we demonstrate that helpers allow females to reduce the rate at which they provision their brood. Female reductions, however, were less than that provided by helpers, so that chicks still received food at a faster rate in the presence of helpers. Despite this, chicks fed by parents and helpers were not heavier than those provisioned by parents alone. This is because maternal load-lightening not only occurs during the chick provisioning stage, but also at the egg investment stage. Theoretically, complete load-lightening is predicted when parents value themselves more highly than their offspring. We tested this idea by 'presenting' mothers with a 'choice' between reducing their own levels of care and increasing investment in their offspring. We found that mothers preferred to cut their contributions to brood care, just as predicted. Our experiments help to explain why helper effects on offspring success have been difficult to detect in superb fairy-wrens, and suggest that the accuracy with which theoretical predictions of parental provisioning rules are matched in cooperative birds depends on measuring maternal responses to helper presence at both the egg and chick stages.
17957354	Molecular diversity of 16S rRNA and gyrB genes in copper mines.	The molecular diversities of the microbial communities from four sites impacted by acid mine drainage (AMD) at Dexing Copper Mine in Jiangxi province of China were studied using 16S rRNA sequences and gyrB sequences. Of the four sampled sites, each habitat exhibited distinct geochemical characteristics and the sites were linked geographically allowing us to correlate microbial community structure to geochemical characteristics. In the present study, we examined the molecular diversity of 16S rRNA and gyrB genes from water at these sites using a PCR-based cloning approach. We found that the microbial community appears to be composed primarily of Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Nitrospira, Firmicutes, Chlorella and unknown phylotypes. Of clones affiliated with Nitrospira, Leptospirillum ferrooxidans, Leptospirillum ferriphilum and Leptospirillum group III were all detected. Principal-component analysis (PCA) revealed that the distribution of the microbial communities was influenced greatly by geochemical characteristics. The overall PCA profiles showed that the sites with similar geochemical characteristics had more similar microbial community structures. Moreover, our results also indicated that gyrB sequence analysis may be very useful for differentiating very closely related species in the study of microbial communities.
17957701	Comparative study of silicone-hydrogel contact lenses surfaces before and after wear using atomic force microscopy.	PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to analyze surface changes of three silicone-hydrogel contact lenses after daily wear. The lenses used in this study were balafilcon A, lotrafilcon B (both surface-treated), and galyfilcon A (non surface-treated). METHODS: To understand how and where proteins, lipids, and other contaminants change contact lenses, surface roughness was assessed through Atomic Force Microscopy Tapping Mode. Roughness parameters were Mean Surface roughness (R(a)), Mean-square-roughness (R(q)), and Maximum roughness (R(max)). The surface topography of unworn and worn lenses was also mapped in great detail. RESULTS: Contact lenses roughness parameters exhibited different values before and after wear and the surface appearance also changed. After wear, balafilcon A and galyfilcon A showed a significant increase on surface roughness parameters, being this increase more accentuated to galyfilcon A. In lotrafilcon B materials no significant changes were observed with wear. CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that surface treatment of silicone-hydrogel contact lenses can play a role in the prevention of a significant increase in roughness, and contribute to the better clinical tolerance of these lenses.
17957779	YesT: a new rhamnogalacturonan acetyl esterase from Bacillus subtilis.	YesT, a putative protein from Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 that has been provisionally classified as a rhamnogalacturonan acetyl esterase (RGAE) in CE-12 family, was cloned, expressed in Escherichiacoli Rosetta (DE3), and purified. The enzyme is monomeric with a molecular mass of 37 kDa and presents thermophilic properties similar to RGAE from Aspergillus aculeatus, although YesT is more alkaliphilic. The study of inhibitors confirmed the importance of the His and the nucleophilic Ser for the esterase activity, apart from the Asp from the catalytic triad. This enzyme also presents broad substrate specificity, and is active toward 7-aminocephalosporanic acid, cephalosporin C, p-nitrophenyl acetate, beta-naphthyl acetate, glucose pentaacetate, and acetylated xylan. Moreover, YesT achieves a synergistic effect together with xylanase A toward acetylated xylan. As a member of the SGNH family, it does not adopt the common alpha/beta hydrolase fold. The primary sequence analysis and multiple sequence alignment revealed the lack of a two beta-stranded antiparallel sheet, which results in a clear change in the structure together with the disappearance of one of the three 3(10)-helices presented in RGAE structure. The similarities found in this article among the topological diagrams of RGAE, YesT, and Esterase A from Streptomyces scabies, Platelet-Activating Factor AcetylHydrolase, isoform Ib, alpha subunit [PAF-AH(Ib)alpha(1)], PAF-AH(Ib)alpha(2), the esterase domain from hemagglutinin esterase fusion glycoprotein (HEF1) from Influenza C virus, the thioesterase I (TAP) from E. coli, the hypothetical protein a1r1529 from Nostoc sp., and the hypothetical YxiM precursor that all belong to the SGNH family could indicate a possible divergence of such proteins from a common ancestor.
17958927	Cognitive training for persons with mild cognitive impairment.	Recent randomized control trials and meta-analyses of experimental studies indicate positive effects of non-pharmacological cognitive training on the cognitive function of healthy older adults. Furthermore, a large-scale randomized control trial with older adults, independent at entry, indicated that training delayed their cognitive and functional decline over a five-year follow-up. This supports cognitive training as a potentially efficient method to postpone cognitive decline in persons with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Most of the research on the effect of cognitive training in MCI has reported increased performance following training on objective measures of memory whereas a minority reported no effect of training on objective cognitive measures. Interestingly, some of the studies that reported a positive effect of cognitive training in persons with MCI have observed large to moderate effect size. However, all of these studies have limited power and few have used long-term follow-ups or functional impact measures. Overall, this review highlights a need for a well-controlled randomized trial to assess the efficacy of cognitive training in MCI. It also raises a number of unresolved issues including proper outcome measures, issues of generalization and choice of intervention format.
17959198	Involvement of the central nervous system in patients with dengue virus infection.	The findings of a neurological evaluation in 85 patients with confirmed, acute, dengue virus infection are described. Signs of central nervous system involvement were present in 18 patients (21.2%). The most frequent neurological symptom was mental confusion. The frequency of neurological involvement did not differ between patients with primary and secondary dengue infection, and the prevalence of central nervous system involvement in dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever also did not differ significantly. The presence of CNS involvement did not influence the prognosis of dengue infection. Dengue viral CSF RNA was found in 7 of 13 patients submitted to a spinal tap, the CSF viral load being less than 1000 copies/ml. PCR was negative in serum samples obtained from three patients on the same day as the CSF samples, suggesting that the dengue virus actively enters the CNS and that the presence of the virus in the CNS does not result from passive crossing of the blood-brain barrier.
17959218	Phytoplankton growth control and risk of cyanobacterial blooms in the lower Senegal River delta region.	Eutrophication, and the resulting proliferation of phytoplankton can affect water quality. Although environmental and ecological processes that lead to phytoplankton proliferations in temperate areas have received considerable attention, scientific background regarding this topic in tropical areas, especially West Africa, are scarce. In this study, bioassays in batch cultures were carried out in order to identify factors that may be stimulating or limiting the biomass of phytoplankton at various sites in the lower Senegal River delta region. Complete factorial designs were used to test several factors both alone and combined (nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfate, EDTA and trace elements, stirring). The effects of these factors on the growth of the whole phytoplankton communities were followed by the daily measurement of in vivo fluorescence. At all but two of the sites, enrichment with certain nutrients significantly stimulated phytoplankton biomass growth, with nitrogen and/or phosphorus appearing to be the primary limiting factor(s). Nitrogen was the primary limiting factor in coastal ocean waters and in the Senegal River estuary. In the freshwater ecosystems studied, nitrogen and phosphorus acted as alternating or concomitant limiting factors. We assessed the changes in the phytoplankton composition induced by nutrient enrichments in Lake Guiers, a drinking water reservoir for the population of Dakar. Our findings lead us to define the conditions of a possible proliferation of the potentially toxic cyanobacterium Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii mainly in response to phosphorus inputs.
17959301	NK cells stimulated with IL-15 or CpG ODN enhance rituximab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity against B-cell lymphoma.	OBJECTIVE: Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) is an important mechanism in the clinical activity of rituximab for treatment of B-cell malignancies. Natural killer (NK) cells, through the activating receptor FcgammaRIIIa (CD16), play a major role in rituximab-mediated ADCC. We have studied the in vitro effect of NK stimulators, such as interleukin-15 (IL-15) and CpG oligodeoxynucleotides A-Class (CpG ODN A), in the enhancement of rituximab-mediated ADCC against B-cell lymphoma. METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), purified NK cells, or NK-depleted PBMC from healthy donors, were activated with IL-15 or CpG ODN A, and cocultured with B-lymphoma cells in the presence of rituximab to evaluate the enhancement of the cytotoxicity. RESULTS: The rituximab-mediated ADCC of IL-15-activated PBMC was twofold compared to unstimulated PBMC (73% +/- 7% vs 37% +/- 5% respectively, p < 0.001). Similarly, rituximab-mediated ADCC was enhanced when PBMC were activated with CpG ODN A as compared to CpG ODN control (61% +/- 11% vs 36% +/- 8%, respectively, p = 0.02). Nevertheless, the ADCC of purified NK cells was increased only with IL-15. NK-depleted PBMC activated with either IL-15 or CpG ODN A showed no ADCC, suggesting that NK are the major effector cells. Furthermore, IL-15 or CpG ODN A-activated PBMC, but not activated purified NK cells, secreted large amounts of interferon-gamma in the presence of rituximab-coated lymphoma cells. CONCLUSIONS: IL-15 and CpG ODN A enhance rituximab-mediated ADCC against B-cell lymphoma. Under these conditions, NK cells seem to be the main effector cells mediating ADCC. These findings suggest that these agents could be used as adjuvants in combination with rituximab for patients with B-cell lymphoma.
17959330	Development and validation of a LC-MS method with electrospray ionization for the determination of the imidazole H3 antagonist ROS203 in rat plasma.	A rapid, simple and sensitive liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) method was developed and validated for the determination of the imidazole H(3) antagonist ROS203 in rat plasma, using the superior homologue ROS287 as internal standard. Analyses were performed on an Agilent 1100 Series HPLC system employing a Supelco Ascentis C(18) column and isocratic elution with acetonitrile-10mM ammonium acetate buffer pH 4.0 (30:70, v/v) at a flow rate of 0.25 mL/min. An Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex 150-EX single quadrupole mass spectrometer, equipped with an electrospray ionization interface was employed, operating in the positive ion mode. Plasma samples were deproteinized with acetonitrile (1:2), evaporated under nitrogen stream, reconstituted in the mobile phase and 5 microL were injected into the system. The retention times of ROS203 and IS were 2.20 and 2.90 min, respectively. Calibration curves in spiked plasma were linear over the concentration range of 2610-2.61 ng/mL with determination coefficients >0.99. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 2.61 ng/mL. The accuracy of the method was within 15%. Intra- and inter-day relative standard deviations were less or equal to 9.50% or 7.19%, respectively. The applicability of the LC-MS method was tested employing plasma samples obtained after i.p. administration of ROS203 to female Wistar rats to support a behavioral in vivo study. The specificity of the method was confirmed by the absence of interferences from endogenous substances. The reported method can provide the necessary sensitivity, linearity, precision, accuracy and specificity to allow the determination of ROS203 in rat plasma samples to support further pharmacokinetic assays.
17959763	Comparison between quantitative nucleic acid sequence-based amplification, real-time reverse transcriptase PCR, and real-time PCR for quantification of Leishmania parasites.	DNA or RNA amplification methods for detection of Leishmania parasites have advantages regarding sensitivity and potential quantitative characteristics in comparison with conventional diagnostic methods but are often still not routinely applied. However, the use and application of molecular assays are increasing, but comparative studies on the performance of these different assays are lacking. The aim of this study was to compare three molecular assays for detection and quantification of Leishmania parasites in serial dilutions of parasites and in skin biopsies collected from cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) patients in Manaus, Brazil. A serial dilution of promastigotes spiked in blood was tested in triplicate in three different runs by quantitative nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (QT-NASBA), quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR), and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). In addition, the costs, durations, and numbers of handling steps were compared, and 84 skin biopsies from patients with suspected CL were tested. Both QT-NASBA and qRT-PCR had a detection limit of 100 parasites/ml of blood, while qPCR detected 1,000 parasites/ml. QT-NASBA had the lowest range of intra-assay variation (coefficients of variation [CV], 0.5% to 3.3%), while qPCR had the lowest range of interassay variation (CV, 0.4% to 5.3%). Furthermore, qRT-PCR had higher r2 values and amplification efficiencies than qPCR, and qPCR and qRT-PCR had faster procedures than QT-NASBA. All assays performed equally well with patient samples, with significant correlations between parasite counts. Overall, qRT-PCR is preferred over QT-NASBA and qPCR as the most optimal diagnostic assay for quantification of Leishmania parasites, since it was highly sensitive and reproducible and the procedure was relatively fast.
17960142	Multivariate and univariate analysis of continuous arterial spin labeling perfusion MRI in Alzheimer's disease.	Continuous arterial spin labeling (CASL) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was combined with multivariate analysis for detection of an Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related cerebral blood flow (CBF) covariance pattern. Whole-brain resting CBF maps were obtained using spin echo, echo planar imaging (SE-EPI) CASL in patients with mild AD (n=12, age=70.7+/-8.7 years, 7 males, modified Mini-Mental State Examination (mMMS)=38.7/57+/-11.1) and age-matched healthy controls (HC) (n=20; age=72.1+/-6.5 years, 8 males). A covariance pattern for which the mean expression was significantly higher (P<0.0005) in AD than in HC was identified containing posterior cingulate, superior temporal, parahippocampal, and fusiform gyri, as well as thalamus, insula, and hippocampus. The results from this analysis were supplemented with those from the more standard, region of interest (ROI) and voxelwise, univariate techniques. All ROIs (17/hemisphere) showed significant decrease in CBF in AD (P<0.001 for all ROIs, alphacorrected=0.05). The area under the ROC curve for discriminating AD versus HC was 0.97 and 0.94 for covariance pattern and gray matter ROI, respectively. Fewer areas of depressed CBF in AD were detected using voxelwise analysis (corrected, P<0.05). These areas were superior temporal, cingulate, middle temporal, fusiform gyri, as well as inferior parietal lobule and precuneus. When tested on extensive split-half analysis to map out the replicability of both multivariate and univariate approaches, the expression of the pattern from multivariate analysis was superior to that of the univariate.
17960558	Regulation of collagen gene expression in the Tsk2 mouse.	The tight skin 2 (Tsk2) mutation is an ENU induced dominant mutation localized on mouse chromosome 1. While the molecular defect is unknown, Tsk2/+ mice display cutaneous thickening associated with excessive matrix production and are used as a model of scleroderma. The purpose of this study was to examine the cellular mechanisms associated with the excessive synthesis of matrix macromolecules using a collagen promoter GFP reporter transgene (pOBCol3.6GFP) as a marker of Col1a1 expression. This analysis of pOBCol3.6GFP expression in Tsk2/+ skin showed an increase in transgene activity compared to wild-type (+/+) samples. In addition, an increased area of "high" GFP fluorescence in Tsk2/+ dermis in both 1- and 4-month-old mice was observed that was also associated with an increased number of dermal fibroblasts per unit area of dermis. These data collectively suggest an important mechanism of Tsk2/+ skin fibrosis; an increased number of collagen expressing cells as well as elevated collagen expression on a per cell basis. During this study it was noted that Tsk2/+ mice appeared consistently smaller than wild-type (+/+) siblings and measurements of body length revealed a decrease (5-10%) in 1- and 2-month-old Tsk2/+ mice as well as a decrease in body weight in both age groups as compared to wild-type (+/+) control mice. Femur length was also decreased (2-9%) in Tsk2/+ mice. Finally, in contrast to Tsk/+ mice that display an emphysema-like lung pathology, histological sections of lungs from Tsk2/+ mice were normal and indistinguishable from wild-type (+/+) controls.
17960768	Germline and somatic NF1 gene mutation spectrum in NF1-associated malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs).	About 10% of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) patients develop malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) and represent considerable patient morbidity and mortality. Elucidation of the genetic mechanisms by which inherited and acquired NF1 disease gene variants lead to MPNST development is important. A study was undertaken to identify the constitutional and somatic NF1 mutations in 34 MPNSTs from 27 NF1 patients. The NF1 germline mutations identified in 22 lymphocytes DNA from these patients included seven novel mutations and a large 1.4-Mb deletion. The NF1 germline mutation spectrum was similar to that previously identified in adult NF1 patients without MPNST. Somatic NF1 mutations were identified in tumor DNA from 31 out of 34 MPNSTs, of which 28 were large genomic deletions. The high prevalence (>90%) of such deletions in MPNST contrast with the =or<20% found in benign neurofibromas and is indicative of the involvement of different mutational mechanisms in these tumors. Coinactivation of the TP53 gene by deletion, or by point mutation along with NF1 gene inactivation, is known to exacerbate disease symptoms in NF1, therefore TP53 gene inactivation was screened. DNA from 20 tumors showed evidence for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) across the TP53 region in 11 samples, with novel TP53 point mutations in four tumors.
17961294	Treatment appraisals and beliefs predict adherence to complementary therapies: a prospective study using a dynamic extended self-regulation model.	OBJECTIVES: Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is used by large numbers of the general public and is increasingly becoming integrated into the mainstream. An understanding of why people use CAM in general has been developed in the literature, but relatively little is known specifically about adherence to CAM. We tested hypotheses (derived from a dynamic extended version of Leventhal's common-sense model) that patients' beliefs about treatment, perceptions of illness, and treatment appraisals would predict adherence to CAM. DESIGN: A prospective self-report questionnaire study was carried out with a 3-month follow-up period. METHODS: A total of 240 patients from five CAM clinics completed self-report questionnaire measures of treatment beliefs, illness perceptions, and treatment appraisals at baseline. Three months later, they completed self-report measures of adherence to therapists' recommendations concerning attendance, remedy use, and life-style changes. RESULTS: Logistic regression analyses showed that positive perceptions of one's therapist and belief that mental factors do not cause illness independently predicted adherence to appointments. Positive beliefs in holistic health and finding it difficult to travel to appointments predicted adherence to remedy use. Using homeopathy was the only independent predictor of adherence to life-style changes. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment appraisals, treatment beliefs, and illness perceptions explain modest proportions of the variance in adherence to CAM. This study highlights the value of operationalizing the appraisal element of the common-sense model when investigating adherence to treatment.
17962221	The representation of spatial attention in human parietal cortex dynamically modulates with performance.	The control and allocation of attention is an essential, ubiquitous neural process that gates our awareness of objects and events in the environment. Neural representations of the locus of spatial attention have been previously demonstrated in parietal cortex. However, the behavioral relevance of these neural representations is not known. While undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging, subjects performed a covert spatial attention task that yielded a wide range of performance values. Voxels in parietal cortex selective for attended target location also dynamically modulated, becoming more or less responsive as performance levels changed. Surprisingly, this relationship was not linear. Responses peaked at intermediate performance levels and dropped both when performance was very high and when it was very low. Such dynamic modulation may represent a mechanism for organizing neural control signals according to behavioral task demands.
17962300	DDBJ with new system and face.	DDBJ (http://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp) collected and released 1 880 115 entries or 1 134 086 245 bases in the period from July 2006 to June 2007.

It is called All-round Retrieval for Sequence and Annotation, which enables the user to search for keywords also in the Feature/Qualifier of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (http://www.insdc.org/). We will also replace our home page with a more efficient one by the end of 2007.
17962307	AtPID: Arabidopsis thaliana protein interactome database--an integrative platform for plant systems biology.	Arabidopsis thaliana Protein Interactome Database (AtPID) is an object database that integrates data from several bioinformatics prediction methods and manually collected information from the literature. It contains data relevant to protein-protein interaction, protein subcellular location, ortholog maps, domain attributes and gene regulation. The predicted protein interaction data were obtained from ortholog interactome, microarray profiles, GO annotation, and conserved domain and genome contexts. This database holds 28,062 protein-protein interaction pairs with 23,396 pairs generated from prediction methods. Among the rest 4666 pairs, 3866 pairs of them involving 1875 proteins were manually curated from the literature and 800 pairs were from enzyme complexes in KEGG. In addition, subcellular location information of 5562 proteins is available. AtPID was built via an intuitive query interface that provides easy access to the important features of proteins. Through the incorporation of both experimental and computational methods, AtPID is a rich source of information for system-level understanding of gene function and biological processes in A. thaliana. Public access to the AtPID database is available at http://atpid.biosino.org/.
17962309	Phospho.ELM: a database of phosphorylation sites--update 2008.	Phospho.ELM is a manually curated database of eukaryotic phosphorylation sites. The resource includes data collected from published literature as well as high-throughput data sets. The current release of Phospho.ELM (version 7.0, July 2007) contains 4078 phospho-protein sequences covering 12 025 phospho-serine, 2362 phospho-threonine and 2083 phospho-tyrosine sites.

17962396	Assessing visual fields for driving in patients with paracentral scotomata.	BACKGROUND: The binocular Esterman visual field test (EVFT) is the current visual field test for driving in the UK. Merging of monocular field tests (Integrated Visual Field, IVF) has been proposed as an alternative for glaucoma patients. AIMS: To examine the level of agreement between the EVFT and IVF for patients with binocular paracentral scotomata, caused by either ophthalmological or neurological conditions, and to compare outcomes with useful field of view (UFOV) performance, a test of visual attention thought to be important in driving. METHODS: 60 patients with binocular paracentral scotomata but normal visual acuity (VA) were recruited prospectively. Subjects completed and were classified as "pass" or "fail" for the EVFT, IVF and UFOV. RESULTS: Good agreement occurred between the EVFT and IVF in classifying subjects as "pass" or "fail" (kappa = 0.84). Classifications disagreed for four subjects with paracentral scotomata of neurological origin (three "passed" IVF yet "failed" EVFT). Mean UFOV scores did not differ between those who "passed" and those who "failed" both visual field tests (p = 0.11). Agreement between the visual field tests and UFOV was limited (EVFT kappa = 0.22, IVF kappa 0.32). CONCLUSIONS: Although the IVF and EVFT agree well in classifying visual fields with regard to legal fitness to drive in the UK, the IVF "passes" some individuals currently classed as unfit to drive due to paracentral scotomata of non-glaucomatous origin. The suitability of the UFOV for assessing crash risk in those with visual field loss is questionable.
17962697	The HOXB4 homeoprotein differentially promotes ex vivo expansion of early human lymphoid progenitors.	The HOXB4 homeoprotein is known to promote the expansion of mouse and human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and progenitors of the myeloid lineages. However, the putative involvement of HOXB4 in lymphopoiesis and particularly in the expansion of early lymphoid progenitor cells has remained elusive. Based on the ability of the HOXB4 protein to passively enter hematopoietic cells, our group previously designed a long-term culture procedure of human HSCs that allows ex vivo expansion of these cells. Here, this method has been further used to investigate whether HOXB4 could cause similar expansion on cells originating from CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) committed at various levels toward the lymphoid lineages. We provide evidence that HOXB4 protein delivery promotes the expansion of primitive HPCs that generate lymphoid progenitors. Moreover, HOXB4 acts on lymphomyeloid HPCs and committed T/natural killer HPCs but not on primary B-cell progenitors. Our results clarify the effect of HOXB4 in the early stages of human lymphopoiesis, emphasizing the contribution of this homeoprotein in the maintenance of the intrinsic lymphomyeloid differentiation potential of defined HPC subsets. Finally, this study supports the potential use of HOXB4 protein for HSC and HPC expansion in a therapeutic setting and furthers our understanding of the mechanisms of the molecular regulation of hematopoiesis.
17962701	Toll-like receptors 3 and 4 are expressed by human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells and can inhibit their T-cell modulatory activity by impairing Notch signaling.	Bone marrow (BM)-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent, nonhemopoietic progenitors that also possess regulatory activity on immune effector cells through different mechanisms. We demonstrate that human BM-derived MSCs expressed high levels of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 3 and 4, which are both functional, as shown by the ability of their ligands to induce nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) activity, as well as the production of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and CXCL10. Of note, ligation of TLR3 and TLR4 on MSCs also inhibited the ability of these cells to suppress the proliferation of T cells, without influencing their immunophenotype or differentiation potential. The TLR triggering effects appeared to be related to the impairment of MSC signaling to Notch receptors in T cells. Indeed, MSCs expressed the Notch ligand Jagged-1, and TLR3 or TLR4 ligation resulted in its strong downregulation. Moreover, anti-Jagged-1 neutralizing antibody and N[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl-l-alanyl)]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT), an inhibitor of Notch signaling, hampered the suppressive activity of MSCs on T-cell proliferation. These data suggest that TLR3 and TLR4 expression on MSCs may provide an effective mechanism to block the immunosuppressive activity of MSCs and therefore to restore an efficient T-cell response in the course of dangerous infections, such as those sustained by double-stranded RNA viruses or Gram-negative bacteria, respectively.
17962815	Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-3 facilitates Fas-mediated neuronal cell death following mild ischemia.	Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3 (TIMP-3) is a natural inhibitor of metalloproteinases involved in matrix degradation and ectodomain shedding of many cell-surface proteins, including death receptors and/or their ligands. In the present study, we examined the role of TIMP-3 in Fas-mediated neuronal cell death following cerebral ischemia, using both gene deletion and pharmacological approaches. In culture, exposure of primary cortical neurons to 2 h of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) resulted in delayed neuronal cell death that was dependent on activation of the death receptor, Fas. Cortical cultures derived from timp-3(-/-) mice displayed partial resistance against OGD-induced neuronal cell death and also displayed increased shedding of Fas ligand (FasL) into the culture media, compared to wild-type control cultures. Both the increased neuroprotection and increased FasL shedding in timp-3(-/-) cultures were reversed by addition of exogenous metalloproteinase inhibitors, recombinant TIMP-3 or GM6001. In vivo, timp-3(-/-) mice showed marked resistance to a brief (30 min) middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), but were not protected against more severe lesions induced by 90 min of MCAO. These studies demonstrate that TIMP-3 facilitates Fas-mediated neuronal cell death following OGD and plays a pro-apoptotic role in mild cerebral ischemia.
17962949	Survivin: a promising biomarker for detection and prognosis of bladder cancer.	Survivin is a 16.5 kDa member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein family that is overexpressed in many malignancies but rarely detected in normal differentiated adult tissues. Functionally, Survivin inhibits apoptosis, promotes cell proliferation, and induces/enhances angiogenesis. In transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder, Survivin has been shown to be a promising biomarker for cancer diagnosis, prognosis and prediction of response to intravesical or systemic therapies. Moreover, in pre-clinical bladder tumor models, inhibition of Survivin expression and/or function has been shown to impede tumor cell proliferation, and markedly induce spontaneous or chemotherapy induced apoptosis. These preliminary findings should now be confirmed in large prospective trials. Furthermore, simplified, quantitative and reproducible assays need to be developed and validated for the detection of Survivin and its different isoforms.
17962980	Induction of full-length survival motor neuron by polyphenol botanical compounds.	The loss of survival motor neuron-1 (SMN1) is responsible for the development of the neurodegenerative disorder spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). A nearly identical copy of SMN1 is present on the same chromosomal region called SMN2. While SMN2 encodes a normal SMN protein, the majority of SMN2-derived transcripts are alternatively spliced, resulting in a truncated protein that lacks the 16 amino acids encoded by SMN exon 7. Numerous studies have shown that the SMN2-derived protein product, called SMNDelta7, is unstable and dysfunctional. Therefore, identifying molecules that stimulate full-length SMN expression from the SMN2 gene could lead to the development of effective therapies for a broad range of SMA patient populations. Polyphenol compounds have been shown to provide benefit in varied genetic disease contexts. For example, epigallocatechin galate (EGCG) was found to correct aberrant alternative mRNA splicing in familiar dysautonomia (FD). A series of polyphenols were screened and a subset was shown to increase full-length SMN expression from SMN2. Curcumin, EGCG, and resveratrol increased exon 7 inclusion of SMN2 transcripts in transient reporter assays. In SMA patient fibroblasts, these compounds stimulated the production of full-length SMN RNA and protein as well as the formation of SMN-containing nuclear gems. Collectively, these compounds elevated total SMN concentrations in SMA patient fibroblasts, potentially through the modulation of SMN2 exon 7 alternative splicing.
17962995	Photodynamic therapy of the canine prostate: intra-arterial drug delivery.	PURPOSE: Interstitial photodynamic therapy (PDT) selectively destroys tissue targeted with a photosensitizer and then exposed to light of a specific wavelength. We report a novel delivery method--intra-arterial drug delivery for PDT of the prostate--in a canine model. METHODS: To evaluate drug distribution, the prostatovesical artery was selectively cannulated and photosensitizers alone or in conjunction with 99m-technetium-labeled macro-aggregated albumin ((99m)Tc-MAA) were injected via a 3 Fr microcatheter in 8 animals. One dog was followed for 3 months to determine tolerance and toxicity. The remaining animals were euthanized and imaged with whole-body single photon emission CT and gamma counting for radioactivity distribution. Photosensitizer distribution was further analyzed by fluorescence confocal microscopy and tissue chemical extraction. To evaluate PDT, the photosensitizer QLT0074 was infused in 3 animals followed by interstitial illumination with 690 nm laser light. RESULTS: Intra-arterial infusion selectively delivered drugs to the prostate, with both radioactivity and photosensitizer levels significantly higher (up to 18 times) than in the surrounding organs (i.e., rectum). With unilateral injection of (99m)Tc-MAA, only the injected half of the prostate showed activity whereas bilateral administration resulted in drug delivery to the entire prostate. PDT resulted in comprehensive damage to the prostate without severe complications or systemic toxicity. CONCLUSION: Injection of radiolabeled MAA into the prostatovesical artery results in distribution within the prostate with negligible amounts reaching the adjacent organs. PDT also demonstrates selective damage to the prostate, which warrants clinical application in targeted prostate therapies.
17963231	Combination of molecular dynamics method and 3D-RISM theory for conformational sampling of large flexible molecules in solution.	We have developed an algorithm for sampling the conformational space of large flexible molecules in solution, which combines the molecular dynamics (MD) method and the three-dimensional reference interaction site model (3D-RISM) theory. The solvent-induced force acting on solute atoms was evaluated as the gradient of the solvation free energy with respect to the solute-atom coordinates. To enhance the computation speed, we have applied a multiple timestep algorithm based on the RESPA (Reversible System Propagator Algorithm) to the combined MD/3D-RISM method. By virtue of the algorithm, one can choose a longer timestep for renewing the solvent-induced force compared with that of the conformational update. To illustrate the present MD/3D-RISM simulation, we applied the method to a model of acetylacetone in aqueous solution. The multiple timestep algorithm succeeded in enhancing the computation speed by 3.4 times for this model case. Acetylacetone possesses an intramolecular hydrogen-bonding capability between the hydroxyl group and the carbonyl oxygen atom, and the molecule is significantly stabilized due to this hydrogen bond, especially in gas phase. The intramolecular hydrogen bond was kept intact during almost entire course of the MD simulation in gas phase, while in the aqueous solutions the bond is disrupted in a significant number of conformations. This result qualitatively agrees with the behavior on a free energy barrier lying upon the process for rotating a torsional degree of freedom of the hydroxyl group, where it is significantly reduced in aqueous solution by a cancellation between the electrostatic interaction and the solvation free energy.
17964035	Screening the phytoremediation potential of desert broom (Baccharis sarothroides Gray) growing on mine tailings in Arizona, USA.	The metal concentrations in a copper mine tailings and desert broom (Baccharis sarothroides Gray) plants were investigated. The metal concentrations in plants, soil cover, and tailings were determined using ICP-OES. The concentration of copper, lead, molybdenum, chromium, zinc, arsenic, nickel, and cobalt in tailings was 526.4, 207.4, 89.1, 84.5, 51.7, 49.6, 39.7, and 35.6mgkg(-1), respectively. The concentration of all elements in soil cover was 10-15% higher than that of the tailings, except for molybdenum. The concentration of copper, lead, molybdenum, chromium, zinc, arsenic, nickel, and cobalt in roots was 818.3, 151.9, 73.9, 57.1, 40.1, 44.6, 96.8, and 26.7mgkg(-1) and 1214.1, 107.3, 105.8, 105.5, 55.2, 36.9, 30.9, and 10.9mgkg(-1) for shoots, respectively. Considering the translocation factor, enrichment coefficient, and the accumulation factor, desert broom could be a potential hyperaccumulator of Cu, Pb, Cr, Zn, As, and Ni.
17964070	Contemporary prostate cancer prevalence among T1c biopsy-referred men with a prostate-specific antigen level < or = 4.0 ng per milliliter.	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prostate cancer (PCa) prevalence and risk factors of men with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level< or =4.0 ng/ml and an unsuspicious digital rectal examination (DRE) in a large biopsy referral cohort. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1997 and 2005, 855 men underwent initial transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided prostate biopsy at the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf. Patients with any previous surgical or medical treatment were excluded from analyses. Logistic regression analyses were performed to determine risk factors of PCa at biopsy and high-grade PCa defined as biopsy Gleason sum> or =7. RESULTS: Overall PCa detection rate was 23.1%. The majority had a biopsy Gleason sum of 6 (79.5%) and 20.5% had a biopsy Gleason sum> or =7. Total PSA (tPSA) and percentage of free PSA (%fPSA) were statistically significantly different in men with and without PCa (all p<0.001). In tPSA strata < or = 0.5, 0.6-1.0, 1.1-2.0, 2.1-3.0, and 3.1-4.0 ng/ml, PCa prevalence was 4.0%, 10.6%, 14.8%, 24.5%, and 32.1%, respectively. In logistic regression analyses addressing PCa and Gleason sum > or = 7 at biopsy, %fPSA and prostate volume represented independent and most informative risk factors. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate that a substantial percentage (23.1%) of men with a PSA< or =4.0 ng/ml and an unsuspicious DRE in a biopsy referral population harbor PCa, with 20.5% being high grade. Low %fPSA and low prostate volume represent important parameters in PCa and in high grade disease detection at biopsy, respectively.
17964838	13C-metabolic flux analysis of Actinobacillus succinogenes fermentative metabolism at different NaHCO3 and H2 concentrations.	Actinobacillus succinogenes naturally produces high concentrations of succinate, a potential intermediary feedstock for bulk chemical productions. A. succinogenes responds to high CO(2) and H(2) concentrations by producing more succinate and by producing less formate, acetate, and ethanol. To determine how intermediary fluxes in A. succinogenes respond to CO(2) and H(2) perturbations, (13)C-metabolic flux analysis was performed in batch cultures at two different NaHCO(3) concentrations, with and without H(2), using a substrate mixture of [1-(13)C]glucose, [U-(13)C]glucose, and unlabeled NaHCO(3). The resulting amino acid, organic acid, and glycogen isotopomers were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and NMR. In all conditions, exchange flux was observed through malic enzyme and/or oxaloacetate decarboxylase. The presence of an exchange flux between oxaloacetate, malate, and pyruvate indicates that, in addition to phosphoenolpyruvate, oxaloacetate, and malate, pyruvate is a fourth node for flux distribution between succinate and alternative fermentation products. High NaHCO(3) concentrations decreased the amount of flux shunted by C(4)-decarboxylating activities from the succinate-producing C(4) pathway to the formate-, acetate-, and ethanol-producing C(3) pathway. In addition, pyruvate carboxylating flux increased in response to high NaHCO(3) concentrations. C(3)-pathway dehydrogenase fluxes increased or decreased appropriately in response to the different redox demands imposed by the different NaHCO(3) and H(2) concentrations. Overall, these metabolic flux changes allowed A. succinogenes to maintain a constant growth rate and biomass yield in all conditions. These results are discussed with respect to A. succinogenes' physiology and to metabolic engineering strategies to increase the flux to succinate.
17964930	Differential scanning calorimetry.	Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) has emerged as a powerful experimental technique for determining thermodynamic properties of biomacromolecules. The ability to monitor unfolding or phase transitions in proteins, polynucleotides, and lipid assemblies has not only provided data on thermodynamic stability for these important molecules, but also made it possible to examine the details of unfolding processes and to analyze the characteristics of intermediate states involved in the melting of biopolymers. The recent improvements in DSC instrumentation and software have generated new opportunities for the study of the effects of structure and changes in environment on the behavior of proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids. This review presents some of the details of application of DSC to the examination of the unfolding of biomolecules. After a brief introduction to DSC instrumentation used for the study of thermal transitions, the methods for obtaining basic thermodynamic information from the DSC curve are presented. Then, using DNA unfolding as an example, methods for the analysis of the melting transition are presented that allow deconvolution of the DSC curves to determine more subtle characteristics of the intermediate states involved in unfolding. Two types of transitions are presented for analysis, the first example being the unfolding of two large synthetic polynucleotides, which display high cooperativity in the melting process. The second example shows the application of DSC for the study of the unfolding of a simple hairpin oligonucleotide. Details of the data analysis are presented in a simple spreadsheet format.
17965130	Equilibrium dynamics of spermine-induced plasmid DNA condensation revealed by fluorescence lifetime correlation spectroscopy.	The spermine-induced DNA condensation is a first-order phase transition. Here, we apply a novel technique fluorescence lifetime correlation spectroscopy to analyze this transition in a greater detail. We show that the method allows for the observation of the condensed and uncondensed molecules simultaneously based solely on different fluorescence lifetimes of the intercalating fluorophore PicoGreen in the folded und unfolded domains of DNA. The auto- and cross-correlation functions reveal that a small fraction of the DNA molecules is involved in the dynamic intramolecular equilibrium. Careful inspection of the cross-correlation curves suggests that folding occurs gradually within milliseconds.
17965165	Genetic and proteomic analyses of a proteasome-activating nucleotidase A mutant of the haloarchaeon Haloferax volcanii.	The halophilic archaeon Haloferax volcanii encodes two related proteasome-activating nucleotidase proteins, PanA and PanB, with PanA levels predominant during all phases of growth. In this study, an isogenic panA mutant strain of H. volcanii was generated. The growth rate and cell yield of this mutant strain were lower than those of its parent and plasmid-complemented derivatives. In addition, a consistent and discernible 2.1-fold increase in the number of phosphorylated proteins was detected when the panA gene was disrupted, based on phosphospecific fluorescent staining of proteins separated by 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Subsequent enrichment of phosphoproteins by immobilized metal ion and metal oxide affinity chromatography (in parallel and sequentially) followed by tandem mass spectrometry was employed to identify key differences in the proteomes of these strains as well as to add to the restricted numbers of known phosphoproteins within the Archaea. In total, 625 proteins (approximately 15% of the deduced proteome) and 9 phosphosites were identified by these approaches, and 31% (195) of the proteins were identified by multiple phosphoanalytical methods. In agreement with the phosphostaining results, the number of identified proteins that were reproducibly exclusive or notably more abundant in one strain was nearly twofold greater for the panA mutant than for the parental strain. Enriched proteins exclusive to or more abundant in the panA mutant (versus the wild type) included cell division (FtsZ, Cdc48), dihydroxyacetone kinase-linked phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system (EI, DhaK), and oxidoreductase homologs. Differences in transcriptional regulation and signal transduction proteins were also observed, including those differences (e.g., OsmC and BolA) which suggest that proteasome deficiency caused an up-regulation of stress responses (e.g., OsmC versus BolA). Consistent with this, components of the Fe-S cluster assembly, protein-folding, DNA binding and repair, oxidative and osmotic stress, phosphorus assimilation, and polyphosphate synthesis systems were enriched and identified as unique to the panA mutant. The cumulative proteomic data not only furthered our understanding of the archaeal proteasome system but also facilitated the assembly of the first subproteome map of H. volcanii.
17965424	Gastrointestinal tolerability of etoricoxib in rheumatoid arthritis patients: results of the etoricoxib vs diclofenac sodium gastrointestinal tolerability and effectiveness trial (EDGE-II).	OBJECTIVE: A randomised, double-blind study to compare the gastrointestinal (GI) tolerability, safety and efficacy of etoricoxib and diclofenac in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 4086 patients (mean age 60.8 years) diagnosed with RA were enrolled and received etoricoxib 90 mg daily (n = 2032) or diclofenac 75 mg twice daily (n = 2054). Use of gastroprotective agents and low-dose aspirin was allowed. The prespecified primary end point consisted of the cumulative rate of patient discontinuations due to clinical and laboratory GI adverse experiences (AEs). General safety was also assessed, including adjudicated thrombotic cardiovascular event data. Efficacy was evaluated using the Patient Global Assessment of Disease Status (PGADS; 0-4 point scale). RESULTS: Mean (SD; maximum) duration of treatment was 19.3 (10.3; 32.9) and 19.1 (10.4; 33.1) months in the etoricoxib and diclofenac groups, respectively. The cumulative discontinuation rate due to GI AEs was significantly lower with etoricoxib than diclofenac (5.2 vs 8.5 events per 100 patient-years, respectively; hazard ratio 0.62 (95% CI: 0.47, 0.81; p<or=0.001)). The incidence of discontinuations for hypertension-related and oedema-related AEs were significantly higher with etoricoxib (2.5% and 1.1% respectively) compared with diclofenac (1.5% and 0.4% respectively; p<0.001 for hypertension and p<0.01 for oedema). Etoricoxib and diclofenac treatment resulted in similar efficacy (PGADS mean changes from baseline -0.62 vs -0.58, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Etoricoxib 90 mg demonstrated a significantly lower risk for discontinuing treatment due to GI AEs compared with diclofenac 150 mg. Discontinuations from renovascular AEs, although less common than discontinuations from GI AEs, were significantly higher with etoricoxib.
17965952	Chromosomal studies in four species of genus Chaunus (Bufonidae, Anura): localization of telomeric and ribosomal sequences after fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).	Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using telomeric and ribosomal sequences was performed in four species of toad genus Chaunus: C. ictericus, C. jimi, C. rubescens and C. schneideri. Analyses based on conventional, C-banding and Ag-NOR staining were also carried out. The four species present a 2n = 22 karyotype, composed by metacentric and submetacentric chromosomes, which were indistinguishable either after conventional staining or banding techniques. Constitutive heterochromatin was predominantly located at pericentromeric regions, and telomeric sequences (TTAGGG)(n) were restricted to the end of all chromosomes. Silver staining revealed Ag-NORs located at the short arm of pair 7, and heteromorphism in size of NOR signals was also observed. By contrast, FISH with ribosomal probes clearly demonstrated absence of any heteromorphism in size of rDNA sequences, suggesting that the difference observed after Ag-staining should be attributed to differences in chromosomal condensation and/or gene activity rather than to the number of ribosomal cistrons.
17966124	Is depression associated with microvascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes?	We hypothesize that late-life depression is a manifestation of microvascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes. We conducted a clinic-based cross-sectional study, comparing retinal vascular caliber, a marker of microvascular disease, in participants with type 2 diabetes with major depression (n=34), without depression (n=27) and healthy non-diabetic controls (n=38). Retinal vascular caliber was measured from digital retinal photographs using a validated computer-assisted method. After adjusting for age and gender, there was a trend of increasing retinal arteriolar caliber from healthy controls (132.6 microm), to diabetic patients without depression (139.2 microm), and diabetic patients with major depression (145.3 microm, P=0.008). The trend in retinal arteriolar caliber remains significant after adjusting for duration of diabetes, but not after further adjusting for vascular risk factors. Our findings suggest that there is variation in the retinal vascular caliber between type 2 diabetic patients with and without major depression and non-diabetic controls. This variation was largely related to poorer diabetes control and a higher frequency of vascular risk factors in diabetic patients, particularly those with depression. Studies with larger sample size may provide further insights into this association.
17967138	Murine and chicken chondrocytes regulate osteoclastogenesis by producing RANKL in response to BMP2.	UNLABELLED: Chondrocytes express RANKL, but their role in osteoclastogenesis is not clear. We report that hypertrophic chondrocytes induce osteoclast formation through RANKL production stimulated by BMP2 and Runx2/Smad1 and thus they may regulate resorption of calcified matrix by osteoclasts at growth plates. INTRODUCTION: Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling and Runx2 regulate chondrogenesis during bone development and fracture repair and RANKL expression by osteoblast/stromal cells. Chondrocytes express RANKL, and this expression is stimulated by vitamin D3, but it is not known if chondrocytes directly support osteoclast formation or if BMPs or Runx2 is involved in this potential regulation of osteoclastogenesis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The chondrocyte cell line, ATDC5, primary mouse sternal chondrocytes, and chick sternal chondrocytes were used. Cells were treated with BMP2, and expression of RANKL and chondrocyte marker genes was determined by real-time RT-PCR and Western blot. Chondrocytes and spleen-derived osteoclast precursors +/- BMP2 were co-cultured to examine the effect of chondrocyte-produced RANKL on osteoclast formation. A reporter assay was used to determine whether BMP2-induced RANKL production is through transcriptional regulation of the RANKL promoter and whether it is mediated by Runx2. RESULTS: BMP2 significantly increased expression of RANKL mRNA and protein in all three types of chondrocytes, particularly by Col X-expressing and upper sternal chondrocytes. Chondrocytes constitutively induced osteoclast formation. This effect was increased significantly by BMP2 and prevented by RANK:Fc. BMP2 significantly increased luciferase activity of the RANKL-luc reporter, and Smad1 increased this effect. Deletion or mutation of Runx2 binding sites within the RANKL promoter or overexpression of a dominant negative Runx2 abolished BMP2- and Smad1-mediated activation of RANKL promoter activity. CONCLUSIONS: Hypertrophic chondrocytes may regulate osteoclastogenesis at growth plates to remove calcified matrix through BMP-induced RANKL expression.
17967436	Quantification of rRNA in Escherichia coli using capillary gel electrophoresis with laser-induced fluorescence detection.	Over the past 10 years, sophisticated powerful techniques have been developed for the quantification of messenger RNA (mRNA) and ribosomal RNA (rRNA), enabling researchers in science, industry, and molecular medicine to explore gene expression. These techniques require the (reverse) transcription of analyte RNA, hybridization with synthetic oligonucleotides, and other additional steps that make them costly, time-consuming, and quantitatively difficult to perform. The current work demonstrates how 16S and 23S rRNA can be quantified precisely using capillary gel electrophoresis with laser-induced fluorescence detection (CGE-LIF) directly after the extraction of total RNA without requiring further reactions or calibration. CGE-LIF normally is used for the qualitative examination of RNA preparations. Its quantitative performance could be improved significantly using MS2 bacteriophage RNA as an internal standard. The entire analytical procedure was validated for linearity, repeatability, reproducibility, and recovery. This validation also included total RNA extraction from bacterial cells, an aspect examined for the first time in absolute RNA quantification. Recovery is close to 100%, and the analytical precision was increased 10-fold (CV<3%), as compared with similar approaches. The demonstrated method is simple and opens up new possibilities for the absolute quantification of not only rRNA but also individual mRNAs.
17967517	A phase I dose-escalation study of fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery in combination with gefitinib in patients with recurrent malignant gliomas.	PURPOSE: To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) with gefitinib in patients with recurrent malignant gliomas. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A Phase I clinical trial was performed. Eligible patients had pathologically proved recurrent anaplastic astrocytoma or glioblastoma. Patients started gefitinib (250 mg/day) 7 days before SRS and continued for 1 year or until disease progression. SRS was delivered in three fractions over 3 days. The planning target volume (PTV) was the T1-weighted MRI postcontrast enhancing lesion+2 mm. The first cohort received an SRS dose of 18 Gy, and subsequent cohorts received higher doses up to the maximum dose of 36 Gy. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was any Grade 3 toxicity. The MTD was exceeded if 2 of 6 patients in a cohort experienced DLT. RESULTS: Characteristics of the 15 patients enrolled were: 9 men, 6 women; median age, 47 years (range, 23-65 years); 11 glioblastoma, 4 AA; median prior RT dose, 60 Gy (range, 54-61.2 Gy); median interval since RT, 12 months (range, 3-57 months); median PTV, 41 cc (range, 12-151 cc). Median follow-up time was 7 months (range, 2-28 months). Median time on gefitinib was 5 months (range, 2-12 months). No patient experienced a DLT, and the SRS dose was escalated from 18 to 36 Gy. Grade 1-2 gefitinib-related dermatitis and diarrhea were common (10 and 7 patients, respectively). CONCLUSION: Fractionated SRS to a dose of 36 Gy in three fractions is well tolerated with gefitinib at daily dose of 250 mg. Further studies of SRS and novel molecular targeted agents are warranted in this challenging clinical setting.
17967852	In vitro and in vivo activities of echinomycin against clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus.	OBJECTIVES: To verify in vitro and in vivo activities of echinomycin against clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, we compared antistaphylococcal activities of echinomycin with those of vancomycin. METHODS: In vitro activities (MICs and MBCs) of oxacillin, vancomycin and echinomycin against 18 isolates of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) and 118 isolates of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) were compared. Using four representative isolates of S. aureus, time-kill assay and in vivo antistaphylococcal activities were assessed. Echinomycin and vancomycin were compared in an in vivo mouse infection model. RESULTS: Echinomycin demonstrated higher in vitro activities against MSSA and MRSA strains, exhibiting 2-fold lower MIC(90)s and 4-fold lower MBC(90)s than vancomycin. Additionally, time-kill assay indicated that echinomycin is more potent than vancomycin against MSSA and MRSA strains in the context of MICs and MBCs. Using an in vivo protection model, it was shown that the 50% effective doses of echinomycin were at least 7-fold lower than those of vancomycin. Therefore, echinomycin displayed excellent protection in mice against acute peritoneal infections caused by both MSSA and MRSA strains. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these data indicate that the activity of echinomycin against S. aureus strains is at least equivalent to that of vancomycin, regardless of the methicillin resistance of these strains. These promising activities of echinomycin might justify its potential use against infections with S. aureus strains resistant to vancomycin. This might be the first report to show that echinomycin possesses antipathogenic staphylococcal activity.
17967884	Role of the PLDLS-binding cleft region of CtBP1 in recruitment of core and auxiliary components of the corepressor complex.	C-terminal binding protein (CtBP) family proteins CtBP1 and CtBP2 are highly homologous transcriptional corepressors and are recruited by a large number of transcription factors to mediate sequence-specific transcriptional repression. In addition to DNA-binding repressors, the nuclear protein complex of CtBP1 consists of enzymatic constituents such as histone deacetylases (HDAC1/2), histone methyl transferases (HMTases; G9a and GLP), and the lysine-specific demethylase (LSD1). Additionally, CtBPs also recruit the components of the sumoylation machinery. The CtBPs contain two different unique structural elements, a hydrophobic cleft, with which factors that contain motifs related to the E1A PLDLS motif bind, and a surface groove that binds with factors containing motifs related to the sequence RRTGXPPXL (RRT motif). By structure-based functional dissection of CtBP1, we show that the PLDLS-binding cleft region functions as the primary recruitment center for DNA-binding factors and for the core and auxiliary enzymatic constituents of the CtBP1 corepressor complex. We identify HDAC1/2, CoREST/LSD1, and Ubc9 (E2) as the core constituents of the CtBP1 complex, and these components interact with the PLDLS cleft region through non-PLDLS interactions. Among the CtBP core constituents, HDACs contribute predominantly to the repression activity of CtBP1. The auxiliary components include an HMTase complex (G9a/Wiz/CDYL) and two SUMO E3 ligases, HPC2 and PIAS1. The interaction of auxiliary components with CtBP1 is excluded by PLDLS (E1A)-mediated interactions. Although monomeric CtBP1 is proficient in the recruiting of both core and auxiliary components, NAD(H)-dependent dimerization is required for transcriptional repression. We also provide evidence that CtBP1 functions as a platform for sumoylation of cofactors.
17967906	Identification and evaluation of a highly effective fusion inhibitor for human metapneumovirus.	Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) can cause acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections that are particularly severe in young children, elderly subjects, and immunocompromised patients. To date, no treatments or vaccines are available for hMPV infections. Our objective was to assess the inhibitory potential of several peptides derived from the heptad repeat A and B (HRA and HRB) domains of the hMPV fusion protein. Nine candidate peptides were expressed in Escherichia coli or obtained synthetically and tested in vitro and in an animal model. Excellent in vitro inhibition of an hMPV strain of the A1 subgroup was obtained with five peptides, with 50% inhibitory concentrations ranging from 1.4 nM to 3.3 microM. One peptide, HRA2, displayed very potent activity against all four hMPV subgroups. It was also moderately active against human respiratory syncytial virus (strain A2) but displayed no activity against human parainfluenza virus type 3. BALB/c mice that received the HRA2 peptide and a lethal hMPV intranasal challenge simultaneously were completely protected from clinical symptoms and mortality. On day 5 postinfection, HRA2-treated mice had undetectable lung viral loads which were significantly less than those of untreated mice (3 x 10(4) 50% tissue culture infective doses/lung). Pulmonary inflammation, levels of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines (RANTES, gamma interferon, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1) and airway obstruction were also significantly decreased in HRA2-treated mice. The results of this study demonstrate that potent antivirals can be derived from the hMPV fusion protein HR domains. Moreover, hMPV, compared to other paramyxoviruses and to the human immunodeficiency virus, seems to be more susceptible to HRA- than HRB-derived peptides.
17968312	A small molecule cell-impermeant Hsp90 antagonist inhibits tumor cell motility and invasion.	Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is a molecular chaperone that maintains function of numerous intracellular signaling nodes utilized by cancer cells for proliferation and survival. Hsp90 is also detected on the plasma membrane of tumor cells and its expression has been suggested to correlate with metastatic potential. Given the abundance and diverse functions of the intracellular pool of this protein, the precise contribution of cell surface Hsp90 to cell motility and tumor metastasis remains to be determined. In this study we utilized the small molecule DMAG-N-oxide, a novel cell-impermeable Hsp90 inhibitor, to specifically examine the role of cell surface Hsp90 in cell motility. We observed that, while not affecting intracellular Hsp90 function, DMAG-N-oxide significantly retarded tumor cell migration and integrin/extracellular matrix-dependent cytoskeletal reorganization. Concomitant with these findings, targeting cell surface Hsp90 significantly inhibited tumor cell motility and invasion in vitro, and had a dramatic impact on melanoma cell lung colonization in vivo. These data indicate that cell surface Hsp90 plays an important role in modulating cancer cell migration that is independent of the function of the intracellular Hsp90 pool, and that small molecule inhibitors of surface Hsp90 may provide a new approach to targeting the metastatic phenotype.
17968314	Differentially expressed genes are marked by histone 3 lysine 9 trimethylation in human cancer cells.	Histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9Me3) has been associated with transcriptional repression, but recent findings implicate this chromatin modification in transcriptional activation and mRNA elongation by RNA polymerase II. Here, we applied immunoprecipitation (IP) with a custom DNA tiling microarray containing many transcription factors important in development and cancer (for example homeotic genes; N=683 total genes) to explore the relationship between H3K9Me3 and other histone modifications with the differential expression of genes. Cancer cell lines derived from different tissues (2 leukemia, 2 medulloblastoma) were characterized with IP antibodies to H3K9Me3, H3K4 dimethylation (H3K4Me2) and H3K9 acetylation (H3K9Ac). MV4-11 is known to overexpress the HOXA9 and MEIS1 genes, whereas D283 overexpresses the OTX2 homeobox gene. Gene expression was assessed by Affymetrix U133 array. Mapping the number and size of histone markings demonstrated significant colocalization of H3K9Ac and H3K4Me2 with H3K9Me3, indicating a pattern of putative 'activating' and 'repressive' markings. The median site size was 600-821 bp and 72-95% or 53-80% of chromatin signal sites were located within 1 kb or 500 bp of transcription start sites (TSS), respectively. A relatively small number of genes displayed additional H3K9Me3 sites in the 5'-region distant from the TSS. Comparing genes with modification sites to those without sites in their promoters confirmed the positive associations of H3K9Ac and H3K4Me2 with gene expression and revealed that H3K9Me3 is associated with active genes rather than being a repressive marking as previously thought. The positive regulatory effect of all three types of modifications were quantitatively correlated with site size, and applied to absolute gene expression within a single cell line as well as relative expression among pairs of cell lines. Extended patterns of H3K9Me3 upstream of some genes (for example HOXA9 and OTX2) may result from the action of multiple promoter elements. We found an inverse relationship between promoter DNA hypermethylation and H3K9Me3 in three studied genes (HOXA9, TMS1, RASSF1A). The localization of H3K9Me3 downstream of the TSSs of expressed genes and not within promoter regions of hypermethylated and silenced genes is consistent with the proposed coupling of H3K9Me3 with RNA polymerase II. Our results indicate a need for revising aspects of the histone code involving H3 lysine methylation. Awareness of H3K9Me3 as a mark of gene activity, not repression, is especially important for the classification of human cancer using chromatin and histone profiles.
17968322	Identification of the novel AML1 fusion partner gene, LAF4, a fusion partner of MLL, in childhood T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia with t(2;21)(q11;q22) by bubble PCR method for cDNA.	The AML1 gene is frequently rearranged by chromosomal translocations in acute leukemia. We identified that the LAF4 gene on 2q11.2-12 was fused to the AML1 gene on 21q22 in a pediatric patient having T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) with t(2;21)(q11;q22) using the bubble PCR method for cDNA. The genomic break points were within intron 7 of AML1 and of LAF4, resulting in the in-frame fusion of exon 7 of AML1 and exon 8 of LAF4. The LAF4 gene is a member of the AF4/FMR2 family and was previously identified as a fusion partner of MLL in B-precursor ALL with t(2;11)(q11;q23), although AML1-LAF4 was in T-ALL. LAF4 is the first gene fused with both AML1 and MLL in acute leukemia. Almost all AML1 translocations except for TEL-AML1 are associated with myeloid leukemia; however, AML1-LAF4 was associated with T-ALL as well as AML1-FGA7 in t(4;21)(q28;q22). These findings provide new insight into the common mechanism of AML1 and MLL fusion proteins in the pathogenesis of ALL. Furthermore, we successfully applied bubble PCR to clone the novel AML1-LAF4 fusion transcript. Bubble PCR is a powerful tool for detecting unknown fusion transcripts as well as genomic fusion points.
17968573	Recent advances in characterizing biological mechanisms underlying UV-induced wrinkles: a pivotal role of fibrobrast-derived elastase.	In clinical studies, the formation of facial wrinkles has been closely linked to the loss of elastic properties of the skin. Cumulative irradiation with ultraviolet (UV) B at suberythemal doses significantly reduces the elastic properties of the skin, resulting in the formation of wrinkles. In in vitro studies, we identified a paracrine pathway between keratinocytes and fibroblasts, which leads to wrinkle formation via the up-regulation of fibroblast elastases that degrade elastic fibers. UVB irradiation stimulates the activity of fibroblast elastases in animal skin. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that cumulative UVB irradiation elicits a marked alteration in the three-dimensional structure of elastic fibers, which is closely associated with the subsequent reduction in the elastic properties of the skin, resulting in wrinkle formation. Studies using anti-wrinkle treatments suggest a close relationship between the recovery of wrinkles and an improvement in the linearity of elastic fibers. Those studies also suggest a close correlation between the recovery in the linearity of elastic fibers and the improvement in skin elasticity. In a study using ovariectomized animals, we characterized the important role of elastase in their high vulnerability to UV-induced wrinkle formation. A synthetic inhibitor specific for fibroblast elastases significantly prevents wrinkle formation without reducing the elastic properties of the skin, accompanied by minor damage in elastic fibers. Finally, we identified an effective extract of Zingiber officinale (L.) Rose from a screen of many herb extracts, which has a safe and potent inhibitory activity against fibroblast elastases. Animal studies using the L. Rose extract revealed that it has significant preventive effects against UVB-induced wrinkle formation, which occur in concert with beneficial effects on skin elasticity. A 1-year clinical study on human facial skin to determine the efficacy of the L. Rose extract demonstrated that it inhibits the UV-induced decrease in skin elasticity and prevents or improves wrinkle formation in skin around the corner of the eye without changing the water content of the stratum corneum. Our long-term studies support our hypothesis for a mechanism of wrinkle formation in which cytokine expression is activated by UV irradiation and triggers dermal fibroblasts to increase the expression of elastase. That increase in elastase results in the deterioration of the three-dimensional architecture of elastic fibers, reducing skin elasticity and finally leading to the formation of wrinkles.
17968585	Aquaporins and cell migration.	Aquaporin (AQP) water channels are expressed primarily in cell plasma membranes. In this paper, we review recent evidence that AQPs facilitate cell migration. AQP-dependent cell migration has been found in a variety of cell types in vitro and in mice in vivo. AQP1 deletion reduces endothelial cell migration, limiting tumor angiogenesis and growth. AQP4 deletion slows the migration of reactive astrocytes, impairing glial scarring after brain stab injury. AQP1-expressing tumor cells have enhanced metastatic potential and local infiltration. Impaired cell migration has also been seen in AQP1-deficient proximal tubule epithelial cells, and AQP3-deficient corneal epithelial cells, enterocytes, and skin keratinocytes. The mechanisms by which AQPs enhance cell migration are under investigation. We propose that, as a consequence of actin polymerization/depolymerization and transmembrane ionic fluxes, the cytoplasm adjacent to the leading edge of migrating cells undergoes rapid changes in osmolality. AQPs could thus facilitate osmotic water flow across the plasma membrane in cell protrusions that form during migration. AQP-dependent cell migration has potentially broad implications in angiogenesis, tumor metastasis, wound healing, glial scarring, and other events requiring rapid, directed cell movement. AQP inhibitors may thus have therapeutic potential in modulating these events, such as slowing tumor growth and spread, and reducing glial scarring after injury to allow neuronal regeneration.
17968858	A non-inferiority test for diagnostic accuracy based on the paired partial areas under ROC curves.	Non-inferiority is a reasonable approach to assessing the diagnostic accuracy of a new diagnostic test if it provides an easier administration or reduces the cost. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is one of the common measures for the overall diagnostic accuracy. However, it may not differentiate the various shapes of the ROC curves with different diagnostic significances. The partial area under the ROC curve (PAUROC) may present an alternative that can provide additional and complimentary information for some diagnostic tests which require false-positive rate that does not exceed a certain level. Non-parametric and maximum likelihood methods can be used for the non-inferiority tests based on the difference in paired PAUROCs. However, their performance has not been investigated in finite samples. We propose to use the concept of generalized p-value to construct a non-inferiority test for diagnostic accuracy based on the difference in paired PAUROCs. Simulation results show that the proposed non-inferiority test not only adequately controls the size at the nominal level but also is uniformly more powerful than the non-parametric methods. The proposed method is illustrated with a numerical example using published data.
17970617	DNA interaction with novel antitumor estradiol-platinum(II) hybrid molecule: a comparative study with cisplatin drug.	Platinum(II)-based anticancer drugs are effective for the management and treatment of several types of cancer. Cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (cisplatin) exerts its antitumor activity by binding to DNA via intrastrand cross-links to d(GpG) (dG = deoxyguanosine) and to d(ApG) (dA = deoxyadenosine), causing DNA bending and interfering with DNA replication and transcription. However, the exact binding modes of other platinum(II)-based antitumor drugs to DNA duplex and their mechanism of action have not been clearly investigated. The aim of this study was to examine the binding of a novel anticancer estradiol-platinum(II) hybrid molecule (CD-37) with calf-thymus DNA in vitro and to compare the results with those obtained with cisplatin drug. Solutions containing various CD-37 or cisplatin concentrations were reacted with DNA at physiological pH. Then, using Fourier transform infrared, ultraviolet-visible, and circular dichroism spectroscopic methods, it was possible to characterize the drug binding mode, the binding constant, and structural variations of DNA in aqueous solution. Spectroscopic evidence showed that cisplatin binds to guanine N7 site with minor perturbations of the backbone phosphate group with an overall binding constant of K(cisPt) = 5.73 (+/- 0.45) x 10(4) M(-1). CD-37 binds to DNA duplex via H-bonding network at low drug concentrations with minor perturbations of guanine N7 site at high drug content and with a binding constant of K(CD-37) = 1.0 (+/- 0.15) x 10(4) M(-1). DNA aggregation occurs at high drug concentration, while DNA remains in the B-family structure.
17970821	Variable selection for model-based high-dimensional clustering and its application to microarray data.	Variable selection in high-dimensional clustering analysis is an important yet challenging problem. In this article, we propose two methods that simultaneously separate data points into similar clusters and select informative variables that contribute to the clustering. Our methods are in the framework of penalized model-based clustering. Unlike the classical L(1)-norm penalization, the penalty terms that we propose make use of the fact that parameters belonging to one variable should be treated as a natural "group." Numerical results indicate that the two new methods tend to remove noninformative variables more effectively and provide better clustering results than the L(1)-norm approach.
17971050	Fine mapping study in Scandinavian families suggests association between coeliac disease and haplotypes in chromosome region 5q32.	The previous genome-wide scan in Scandinavian families supported earlier evidence for linkage of a region on chromosome 5 (5q31-33) to coeliac disease. This study deals with further genetic mapping of an 18 cM region, spanning from marker GAh18A (131.87 Mb) to D5S640 (149.96 Mb). Linkage and association analyses were performed in a two-step approach. First, seven microsatellites were added. Strong evidence for linkage was obtained with a Zlr score of 3.96, P(nc) = 4 x 10(-5) at marker D5S436. The strongest association was with a haplotype consisting of the markers D5S2033 and D5S2490 (P(nc) < 0.001). In the second step, we added 17 microsatellites and 69 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to the analysis. These markers were located close to or within candidate genes across the region of approximately 7 Mb beneath the linkage peak marked by D5S2017 and D5S812. A substantial increase of the linkage signal with a maximum Zlr score of 4.6 at marker rs1972644 (P(nc) = 2 x 10(-6)) was obtained and several SNPs showed association. Seven SNPs that individually showed the strongest association were genotyped in a second independent family sample set (225 trios). In the trio family sample as well as in the multiplex family sample, the strongest association was found with SNPs within the region flanked by the associated microsatellites D5S2033 and D5S2490 at 5q32.
17971075	LRRK2 is a component of granular alpha-synuclein pathology in the brainstem of Parkinson's disease.	Classical Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the appearance of Lewy bodies (LBs) in affected brain regions, showing mostly compact alpha-synuclein deposition, in contrast with punctate or granular deposition, hypothesized to represent early stages of aggregation. Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is the commonest mutated gene in inherited and idiopathic PD. LRRK2 mutation carriers display a diverse neuropathology, including alpha-synuclein and tau inclusions, suggesting an upstream role for LRRK2 in protein aggregation. We studied LRRK2 expression throughout the normal human brain with three different antibodies. We also examined the pattern of LRRK2 expression in relation to alpha-synuclein aggregation and LB formation in the brainstem of sporadic LB disease. Physiological LRRK2 expression was not restricted to regions preferentially affected in PD and LRRK2 often localized to the nuclear envelope in addition to the known cytoplasmic expression. In PD, we were able to consistently detect LRRK2 in the halo of a minority (approximately 10%) of nigral LBs using three different antibodies. Only one antibody detected LRRK2 in the core of approximately 80% of classic LBs. In the lower brainstem, most notably in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, we found previously unrecognized LRRK2 labelling of complex globular lesions, filled with LB-like matter showing a punctate or granular staining for alpha-synuclein. This was often accompanied by strong LRRK2 expression within dystrophic neurites. Our findings confirm widespread physiological LRRK2 expression in the human brain and suggest an association of LRRK2 with possible early-stage alpha-synuclein pathology in the brainstem of PD.
17971103	Presence of a sexual problem may not affect women's satisfaction from their sexual function.	INTRODUCTION: It has been proposed that women's sexual problems/dysfunctions, in the absence of personal and interpersonal distress, may have little clinical importance, as they may not necessarily affect women's sexual satisfaction. However, data are missing to support such interpretation. AIM: The objective of the present study was to examine whether the presence of a sexual problem necessary affects women's satisfaction with sexual function. METHOD: The study included 164 women who visited a general hospital because of symptoms not related to their sexual function and were asked to complete voluntarily and anonymously demographic data and two questionnaires. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Women completed the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI)--an instrument which evaluates women sexual function--and the Symptom Checklist of Sexual Function-women version (SCSF-w), a screening tool of women's self-perception of sexual function. RESULTS: Mean patients' age was 43 +/- 12.6 (18-72) years. According to the FSFI, 48.8% of the participants had a sexual dysfunction. However, based on their self-perception of sexual function (SCSF), 80.5% of the sample declared to be satisfied with their sexual function, despite the fact that 69.5% of them reported at least one sexual problem. Of all women, only 26.2% would like to talk about their sexual problem(s) with a doctor (57.4% of those who are "bothered" by their sexual symptoms). Logistic regression analysis revealed no association between any sexual dysfunction and women's satisfaction from their sexual function. CONCLUSION: Despite the presence of sexual problem(s), women may be satisfied with their sexual function, but half of those who are bothered would like to talk about it with their doctor. The presence of a sexual problem or its severity is not a determinant of women's help-seeking behavior. Such data strongly support current definitions of women's sexual dysfunction, where the presence of personal distress has been included as a crucial dimension.
17971343	Self-esteem and satisfaction with life of deaf and hard-of-hearing people--a resource-oriented approach to identity work.	In the context of the current identity discussions, the interrelations between acculturations, psychological resources, and self-esteem as well as the satisfaction with life of deaf and hard-of-hearing people (N = 629) were examined by means of a questionnaire-based survey. To check these interrelations, one-factor and two-factor analyses of variance were employed. The results show that bicultural, deaf, and hearing acculturation styles have the advantage over marginal acculturation, but the results for marginal acculturation need to be discussed in depth to ensure a comprehensive understanding of them. All in all, bicultural acculturation seems to be a secure option for psychosocial well-being. The availability of psychological resources (optimism, self-efficacy) seems to be of special importance for the quality of self-esteem and satisfaction with life. On the other hand, the power of these psychological resources is closely associated with good communicative conditions in the individual biographies of the participants in this study as well as with their education level. Going beyond a methodological discussion then, the mission for educators would seem to be one of making good communicative conditions available to each deaf or hard-of-hearing child and optimizing academic achievement so as to ensure a secure, comprehensive, and differentiated opening up of the world and psychological empowerment. In this way, a good foundation can be laid for developing quality of life.
17972089	Primiparity, assisted reproduction, and preterm birth in twin pregnancies: a population based study.	OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of pregnancy complications among primiparous patients with twin gestation in our population and to investigate the association between the increased rates of assisted reproduction (ART) in twin gestation and preterm birth (PTD). MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective population based cohort study was designed, including all twin deliveries after 24 weeks gestation (n = 2,601). The study group included 666 primiparous women and the comparison group 1,935 multiparous women. Maternal characteristics and perinatal outcome were evaluated. Women with fetal malformations were excluded. A multiple logistic regressions analysis for independent risk factors was performed including factors that were significantly different between the study groups in the univariate analysis. Patient's data were obtained from computerized database and analyzed using SPSS statistical package. RESULTS: Primiparous women had a significantly higher rate of preeclampsia, chronic hypertension, ART, prelabor rupture of membranes (PROM) preterm deliveries (PTD), labor dystocia, cesarean section (CS) and vacuum extraction of the first twin than the multiparous group. Primiparous patients had a significantly lower gestational age at delivery and neonatal birth weight of the first and second twin. In multiple logistic regressions analysis primiparity and ART were independent risk factors for PTD, (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.18-1.78; OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.09-1.71, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: (1) Primiparous patients with twin gestation represent a unique population with high rate of infertility and underlying diseases such as chronic hypertension in comparison to the multiparous women with twin gestation; (2) primiparity is an independent risk factor for prematurity in twin gestations; and (3) although primiparous women had an increased maternal complications, neonatal mortality rates were not significantly different from multiparous women.
17973562	Survival rates and blood metal concentrations in two species of free-ranging North American sea ducks.	Populations of several species of North American sea ducks have declined in the past few decades. Exposure to environmental contaminants, particularly metals, has been proposed as one of many possible factors contributing to these declines. Population dynamics are influenced by survival rates and breeding effort. In the present study, we examined the relationships between blood metal concentrations (Cd, Pb, Se, and Hg) and apparent annual survival and recapture probabilities (the latter as a surrogate for breeding effort) in adult females of two sea duck species, the king eider (Somateria spectabilis) and the white-winged scoter (Melanitta fusca), both of which have experienced declines in continental population during in recent years. No support was found for the hypothesis that exposure of white-winged scoters to these metals or of king eiders to Cd, Se, and Pb adversely affected probabilities of apparent annual survival. We detected a weak negative relationship (beta = -0.833) between Hg and annual survival of king eiders, but the 90% confidence interval of the slope estimate overlapped zero (-2.439 to +0.672). Recapture probabilities were unrelated to concentrations of Cd, Se, and Pb in either species. Evidence indicated that Hg concentrations affected recapture probability in white-winged scoters (beta = -194.77; 90% confidence interval, -203.770 to -185.778). Mercury levels were low in both species, and blood samples may not adequately represent long-term exposure to Hg. Therefore, conclusions regarding Hg effects on these birds should be considered with caution.
17974502	Electronic communications and home blood pressure monitoring (e-BP) study: design, delivery, and evaluation framework.	BACKGROUND: Randomized controlled trials have provided unequivocal evidence that treatment of hypertension decreases mortality and major disability from cardiovascular disease; however, blood pressure remains inadequately treated in most affected individuals. This large gap continues despite the facts that more than 90% of adults with hypertension have health insurance, and hypertension is the leading cause of visits to the doctor. New approaches are needed to improve hypertension care. OBJECTIVES: The Electronic Communications and Home Blood Pressure Monitoring (e-BP) study is a three-arm randomized controlled trial designed to determine whether care based on the Chronic Care Model and delivered over the Internet improves hypertension care. The primary study outcomes are systolic, diastolic, and blood pressure control; secondary outcomes are medication adherence, patient self-efficacy, satisfaction and quality of life, and healthcare utilization and costs. METHODS: Hypertensive patients receiving care at Group Health medical centers are eligible if they have uncontrolled blood pressure on two screening visits and access to the Web and an e-mail address. Study participants are randomly assigned to three intervention groups: (a) usual care; (b) home blood pressure monitoring receipt and proficiency training on its use and the Group Health secure patient website (with secure e-mail access to their healthcare provider, access to a shared medical record, prescription refill and other services); or (c) this plus pharmacist care management (collaborative care management between the patient, the pharmacist, and the patient's physician via a secure patient website and the electronic medical record). CONCLUSION: We will determine whether a new model of patient-centered care that leverages Web communications, self-monitoring, and collaborative care management improves hypertension control. If this model proves successful and cost-effective, similar interventions could be used to improve the care of large numbers of patients with uncontrolled hypertension.
17975735	Development of a novel hot-start multiplex PCR for simultaneous detection of classical swine fever virus, African swine fever virus, porcine circovirus type 2, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus and porcine parvovirus.	A novel hot-start multiplex PCR (mPCR) assay was developed and subsequently evaluated for its effectiveness in simultaneously detecting multiple viral infections of swine. Specific primers for each of five virus genomes, namely classical swine fever virus (CSFV), African swine fever virus (ASFV), porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and porcine parvovirus (PPV) were used. Combined nucleic acid purification was carried out using a commercial RNA/DNA extraction kit. The mPCR consisted of a two-step procedure which included reverse transcription and PCR amplification. This mPCR and the corresponding separate assays were evaluated comparatively on serial ten-fold dilutions of each virus. Analysis of the sensitivity in comparison to the corresponding single PCR (sPCR) for the detection of each of the five targets was identical for CSFV, PCV2 and PPV, 1 log lower for PRRSV and 2 logs lower for ASFV. No spurious PCR amplification reactions among all five pathogens were noticed with various amounts of DNA and RNA mixtures. All the uninfected controls were scored negative. The relative efficiency of the mPCR developed in this study compared to performing sPCR for each virus, suggests its potential application for routine molecular diagnostic purposes.
17975838	Factors affecting the use of 13C(alpha) chemical shifts to determine, refine, and validate protein structures.	Interest centers here on the analysis of two different, but related, phenomena that affect side-chain conformations and consequently 13C(alpha) chemical shifts and their applications to determine, refine, and validate protein structures. The first is whether 13C(alpha) chemical shifts, computed at the DFT level of approximation with charged residues is a better approximation of observed 13C(alpha) chemical shifts than those computed with neutral residues for proteins in solution. Accurate computation of 13C(alpha) chemical shifts requires a proper representation of the charges, which might not take on integral values. For this analysis, the charges for 139 conformations of the protein ubiquitin were determined by explicit consideration of protein binding equilibria, at a given pH, that is, by exploring the 2(xi) possible ionization states of the whole molecule, with xi being the number of ionizable groups. The results of this analysis, as revealed by the shielding/deshielding of the 13C(alpha) nucleus, indicated that: (i) there is a significant difference in the computed 13C(alpha) chemical shifts, between basic and acidic groups, as a function of the degree of charge of the side chain; (ii) this difference is attributed to the distance between the ionizable groups and the 13C(alpha) nucleus, which is shorter for the acidic Asp and Glu groups as compared with that for the basic Lys and Arg groups; and (iii) the use of neutral, rather than charged, basic and acidic groups is a better approximation of the observed 13C(alpha) chemical shifts of a protein in solution. The second is how side-chain flexibility influences computed 13C(alpha) chemical shifts in an additional set of ubiquitin conformations, in which the side chains are generated from an NMR-derived structure with the backbone conformation assumed to be fixed. The 13C(alpha) chemical shift of a given amino acid residue in a protein is determined, mainly, by its own backbone and side-chain torsional angles, independent of the neighboring residues; the conformation of a given residue itself, however, depends on the environment of this residue and, hence, on the whole protein structure. As a consequence, this analysis reveals the role and impact of an accurate side-chain computation in the determination and refinement of protein conformation. The results of this analysis are: (i) a lower error between computed and observed 13C(alpha) chemical shifts (by up to 3.7 ppm), was found for approximately 68% and approximately 63% of all ionizable residues and all non-Ala/Pro/Gly residues, respectively, in the additional set of conformations, compared with results for the model from which the set was derived; and (ii) all the additional conformations exhibit a lower root-mean-square-deviation (1.97 ppm < or = rmsd < or = 2.13 ppm), between computed and observed 13C(alpha) chemical shifts, than the rmsd (2.32 ppm) computed for the starting conformation from which this additional set was derived. As a validation test, an analysis of the additional set of ubiquitin conformations, comparing computed and observed values of both 13C(alpha) chemical shifts and chi(1) torsional angles (given by the vicinal coupling constants, 3J(N-Cgamma) and 3J(C'-Cgamma), is discussed.
17976815	Effect of an educational video on emergency department patient stroke knowledge.	The purpose of this study was to explore whether passive watching of a stroke videotape in the Emergency Department waiting room could be an effective method for patient education. The setting was an urban, inner city teaching hospital. After providing informed consent, subjects were randomized into two arms: those watching a 12-min educational video on stroke developed by the American Stroke Association (video group) and those not undergoing an intervention (control group). Both groups were administered a 13-question quiz covering different stroke-related issues, but only the video group received this same test again after the completion of the educational program. Those enrolled were contacted after 1 month to determine knowledge retention via the same test. Immediately after watching the educational program, participants demonstrated improved knowledge of stroke-related questions, with an increase of test scores from 6.7 +/- 2.5 to 9.5 +/- 2.6 (p < 0.01). Even at the 1-month follow-up, the video group had significantly higher test scores than the control group. A stroke educational videotape improves the knowledge of this dangerous disease and may be a valuable and relatively low-cost tool for focused patient education in the Emergency Department waiting room.
17976931	Genetic diversity of the envelope glycoprotein E2 of classical swine fever virus: recent isolates branched away from historical and vaccine strains.	The envelope glycoprotein E2 of classical swine fever virus (CSFV) plays multiple roles in the viral life cycle, interaction with host and pathogenesis. We sequenced the E2 gene of 34 CSFV isolates from southeastern China for analysis of genetic diversity in this particular region. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that genotype 2.1b viruses became predominant in southeastern China with 33 isolates clustered in 2.1b and only 1 isolate belonged to 2.2. Pairwise comparisons demonstrated isolates in this study showed a homology of 78.4-82.6% to Chinese C-strain in the 190nt of the E2 fragment. The minimum similarity within the 2.1b isolates was 91.1%. Variability of the full length E2 amino acid sequences of 45 CSFV isolates representative of three main groups of CSFV including 19 from southeastern China during 2004--2007 and 26 from other parts of China and other countries was analyzed by the differences between non-synonymous (dN) and synonymous (dS) rates and the entropy values. Two variable and three conserved regions as well as some specific positions under positive selection were defined. Our results suggest that recent isolates from southeastern China have shifted away from historical CSFV isolates including the vaccine strains probably as a result of their adaptive abilities to the selection forces within the host.
17976953	Interpopulation linkage disequilibrium patterns of GABRA2 and GABRG1 genes at the GABA cluster locus on human chromosome 4.	GABRA2 and GABRG1, which encode the alpha-2 and gamma-1 subunits, respectively, of the GABA(A) receptor, are located in a cluster on chromosome 4p. The GABRA2 locus has been found to be associated with alcohol dependence in several studies, but no functional variant that can account for this association has been identified. To understand the reported associations, we sought to understand the linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns and haplotype structures of these genes. With close intergenic distance, approximately 90 kb, it was anticipated that some markers might show intergenic LD. Variation in 13-SNP haplotype block structure was observed in five different populations: European American, African American, Chinese (Han and Thai), Thai, and Hmong. In the Hmong, a 280-kb region of considerably higher LD spans the intergenic region, whereas in other populations, there were two or more LD blocks that cross this region. These findings may aid in understanding the genetic association of this locus with alcohol dependence in several populations.
17977017	Symmetry-adapted spherical harmonics method for high-resolution 3D single-particle reconstructions.	Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction is the last and an essential step toward high-resolution structural determination in single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM). We have implemented a new algorithm for reconstructing 3D structures of macromolecular complexes with icosahedral symmetry from cryoEM images. Icosahedral symmetry-adapted functions (ISAFs) are used to interpolate structural factors in the reciprocal space to generate a 3D reconstruction in spherical coordinates. In our implementation, we introduced a recursive method for deriving higher order ISAFs from three lower order seed functions. We demonstrate improvements of our new method in both the noise suppression and the effective resolution in 3D reconstruction over the commonly used Fourier-Bessel synthesis method introduced by Crowther et al. three decades ago. Our 3D reconstruction method can be extended to macromolecular complexes with other symmetry types and is thus likely to impact future high-resolution cryoEM single-particle reconstruction efforts in general.
17977018	A dose-rate effect in single-particle electron microscopy.	A low beam intensity, low electron dose imaging method has been developed for single-particle electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM). Experiments indicate that the new technique can reduce beam-induced specimen movement and secondary radiolytic effects, such as "bubbling". The improvement in image quality, especially for multiple-exposure data collection, will help single-particle cryo-EM to reach higher resolution.
17977022	Fast oscillations associated with interictal spikes localize the epileptogenic zone in patients with partial epilepsy.	Although interictal epileptic spikes are defined as fast transient activity, the spatial distribution of spike-related high-frequency power changes is unknown. In this study, we localized the sources of spike-locked power increases in the beta and gamma band with magnetoencephalography and an adaptive spatial filtering technique and tested the usefulness of these reconstructions for determining the epileptogenic zone in a population of 27 consecutive presurgical patients with medication refractory partial epilepsies. The reliability of this approach was compared to the performance of conventional MEG techniques such as equivalent current dipole (ECD) models. In patients with good surgical outcome after a mean follow-up time of 16 months (Engel class I or II), the surgically resected area was identified with an accuracy of 85% by sources of spike-locked beta/gamma activity, which compared favorably with the accuracy of 69% found for ECD models of single spikes. In patients with a total of more than 50 spikes in their recordings, the accuracies increased to 100% vs. 88%, respectively. Imaging of spike-locked beta/gamma power changes therefore seems to be a reliable and fast alternative to conventional MEG techniques for localizing epileptogenic tissue, in particular, if more than 50 interictal spikes can be recorded.
17977060	Hox genes and the parasitic flatworms: new opportunities, challenges and lessons from the free-living.	Research into the roles played by Hox and related homeotic gene families in the diverse and complex developmental programmes exhibited by parasitic flatworms (Platyhelminthes) can hardly be said to have begun, and thus presents considerable opportunity for new research. Although featured in some of the earliest screens for homeotic genes outside Drosophila and mice, surveys in parasitic flatworms are few in number and almost nothing is yet known of where or when the genes are expressed during ontogeny. This contrasts sharply with a significant body of literature concerning Hox genes in free-living flatworms which have long served as models for the study of regeneration and the maintenance of omnipotent cell lines. Nevertheless, available information suggests that the complement of Hox genes and other classes of homeobox-containing genes in parasitic flatworms is typical of their free-living cousins and of other members of the Lophotrochozoa. Recent work on Schistosoma combined with information on Hox gene expression in planarians indicates that at least some disruption of the clustered genomic arrangement of the genes, as well as of the strict spatial and temporal colinear patterns of expression typical in other groups, may be characteristic of flatworms. However, available data on the genomic arrangement and expression of flatworm Hox genes is so limited at present that such generalities are highly tenuous. Moreover, a basic underlying pattern of colinearity is still observed in their spatial expression patterns making them suitable as cell or region-specific markers. I discuss a number of fundamental developmental questions and some of the challenges to addressing them in relation to each of the major parasitic lineages. In addition, I present newly characterized Hox genes from the model tapeworm Hymenolepis and analyze these by Bayesian inference together with >100 Hox and ParaHox homeodomains of flatworms and select lophotrochozoan taxa, providing a phylogenetic scaffold for their identification.
17977528	PET imaging of dopamine transporter and drug craving during methadone maintenance treatment and after prolonged abstinence in heroin users.	It has been documented that methadone maintenance treatment is effective in reducing drug craving and relevant risk behaviors in heroin users. However, it is not understood whether methadone maintenance treatment impairs the dopamine transporter in the striatum. To establish whether chronic opiate use might impair brain dopamine neurons in humans, we assessed dopamine transporter (DAT) uptake function in the striatum (caudate and putamen), and analyzed the correlation between DAT in the striatum and heroin craving and subjective anxiety in former heroin users with prolonged abstinence and in patients receiving methadone maintenance treatment. Binding of [(11)C]-2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-aryltropane ([(11)C] CFT) as a brain dopamine transporter ligand was measured with positron emission tomography (PET) in eleven former heroin users with prolonged abstinence, ten patients receiving methadone maintenance treatment and ten healthy control subjects. Heroin craving and subjective anxiety in prolonged abstinence and methadone maintenance treatment groups were assessed and the correlations between DAT of striatum and heroin craving or subjective anxiety were determined. In comparison with healthy control subjects, methadone maintenance treatment subjects had lower DAT uptake function in the bilateral caudate and putamen and prolonged abstinence subjects showed significantly lower DAT uptake function in the bilateral caudate. Moreover, in comparison to the prolonged abstinence subjects, the methadone maintenance treatment subjects showed significant decreases of DAT uptake in the bilateral putamen. DAT uptake function in bilateral striatum was not associated with heroin craving in prolonged abstinence or in methadone maintenance treatment subjects; however, DAT uptake function in the bilateral caudate was significantly correlated with subjective anxiety in methadone maintenance treatment subjects. Our findings suggest that chronic opioid use induces long-lasting striatum dopamine neuron impairment, and prolonged withdrawal from opioids can benefit the recovery of impaired dopamine neurons in the brain.
17977720	Biodiesel production by supercritical process with crude bio-methanol prepared by wood gasification.	In order to prepare a genuine biodiesel, it is essential to use methanol prepared from biomass but not natural gas for biodiesel production. Thus, we have proposed to use crude bio-methanol produced by wood gasification for biodiesel production. Since such a bio-methanol contains some impurities, an effect of its impurities was studied on the biodiesel production by supercritical method. In general, impurities in crude bio-methanol are reported to include methyl formate, ethanol, 1-butanol, diisopropyl ether, water, etc. Triglycerides and oleic acids were, thus, treated with these impurities under supercritical conditions. As a result, it was found that methyl formate, ethanol and 1-butanol could convert them to fatty acid alkyl esters (BDF), whereas no conversion was achieved with diisopropyl ether. Thus, crude bio-methanol can be used for BDF production as a substitute for methanol from fossil resources. However, due to more efficient reaction, crude bio-methanol can be more applicable to the two-step supercritical methanol process, consisting of hydrolysis of triglycerides and subsequent esterification of fatty acids, compared with the one-step supercritical methanol process, where transesterification of triglycerides is a major reaction.
17977789	Increasing rates of vancomycin resistance among Enterococcus faecium isolated from German hospitals between 2004 and 2006 are due to wide clonal dissemination of vancomycin-resistant enterococci and horizontal spread of vanA clusters.	Results of national and international surveillance studies revealed increasing rates of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF) among German hospital patients since 2003. To investigate the molecular background of vanA-type glycopeptide resistance, 51 clinical VREF isolated between 2004 and 2006 and originating from 19 German hospitals representing 10 Federal States have been investigated. Isolates were characterised by multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), SmaI macrorestriction analysis in pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA). Phylogenetic relatedness between strains was identified using BioNumerics and eBURST software. Distribution of virulence markers esp and hyl(Efm) was investigated by PCR. The structure of the vanA gene clusters was investigated by PCR, long-template PCR, sequencing and Southern hybridisations. The 51 VREF were rather diverse constituting different strain types, different virulence markers and vanA clusters. Within this diversity we found supportive data for a dissemination of related--already vancomycin-resistant--E. faecium among various hospitals and Federal States and for spread of identical vanA gene clusters among clonally different strain types within single hospitals. In conclusion, the increase in the rates of VREF among German hospital patients within the last 2 years might be rather complex and due to different molecular events and scenarios.
17977838	Novel roles in human MD-2 of phenylalanines 121 and 126 and tyrosine 131 in activation of Toll-like receptor 4 by endotoxin.	Potent mammalian cell activation by Gram-negative bacterial endotoxin requires sequential protein-endotoxin and protein-protein interactions involving lipopolysaccharide-binding protein, CD14, MD-2, and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). TLR4 activation requires simultaneous binding of MD-2 to endotoxin (E) and the ectodomain of TLR4. We now describe mutants of recombinant human MD-2 that bind TLR4 and react with E.CD14 but do not support cellular responsiveness to endotoxin. The mutants F121A/K122A MD-2 and Y131A/K132A MD-2 react with E.CD14 only when co-expressed with TLR4. Single mutants K122A and K132A each react with E.CD14 +/- TLR4 and promote TLR4-dependent cell activation by endotoxin suggesting that Phe(121) and Tyr(131) are needed for TLR4-independent transfer of endotoxin from CD14 to MD-2 and also needed for TLR4 activation by bound E.MD-2. The mutant F126A MD-2 reacts as well as wild-type MD-2 with E.CD14 +/- TLR4. E.MD-2(F126A) binds TLR4 with high affinity (K(d) approximately 200 pm) but does not activate TLR4 and instead acts as a potent TLR4 antagonist, inhibiting activation of HEK/TLR4 cells by wild-type E.MD-2. These findings reveal roles of Phe(121) and Tyr(131) in TLR4-independent interactions of human MD-2 with E.CD14 and, together with Phe(126), in activation of TLR4 by bound E.MD-2. These findings strongly suggest that the structural properties of E.MD-2, not E alone, determine agonist or antagonist effects on TLR4.
17978098	Distinct roles for two Galpha-Gbeta interfaces in cell polarity control by a yeast heterotrimeric G protein.	Saccharomyces cerevisiae mating pheromones trigger dissociation of a heterotrimeric G protein (Galphabetagamma) into Galpha-guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and Gbetagamma. The Gbetagamma dimer regulates both mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade signaling and cell polarization. Here, by independently activating the MAP kinase pathway, we studied the polarity role of Gbetagamma in isolation from its signaling role. MAP kinase signaling alone could induce cell asymmetry but not directional growth. Surprisingly, active Gbetagamma, either alone or with Galpha-GTP, could not organize a persistent polarization axis. Instead, following pheromone gradients (chemotropism) or directional growth without pheromone gradients (de novo polarization) required an intact receptor-Galphabetagamma module and GTP hydrolysis by Galpha. Our results indicate that chemoattractant-induced cell polarization requires continuous receptor-Galphabetagamma communication but not modulation of MAP kinase signaling. To explore regulation of Gbetagamma by Galpha, we mutated Gbeta residues in two structurally distinct Galpha-Gbeta binding interfaces. Polarity control was disrupted only by mutations in the N-terminal interface, and not the Switch interface. Incorporation of these mutations into a Gbeta-Galpha fusion protein, which enforces subunit proximity, revealed that Switch interface dissociation regulates signaling, whereas the N-terminal interface may govern receptor-Galphabetagamma coupling. These findings raise the possibility that the Galphabetagamma heterotrimer can function in a partially dissociated state, tethered by the N-terminal interface.
17979143	Informatics development: challenges and solutions for MALDI mass spectrometry.	Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) has been successfully applied to elucidating biological questions trough the analysis of proteins, peptides, and nucleic acids. Here, we review the different approaches for analyzing the data that is generated by MALDI-MS. The first step in the analysis is the processing of the raw data to find peaks that correspond to the analytes. The peaks are characterized by their areas (or heights) and their centroids. The peak area can be used as a measure of the quantity of the analyte, and the centroid can be used to determine the mass of the analyte. The masses are then compared to models of the analyte, and these models are ranked according to how well they fit the data and their significance is calculated. This allows the determination of the identity (sequence and modifications) of the analytes. We show how this general data analysis workflow is applied to protein and nucleic acid chemistry as well as proteomics.
17979984	Subversion of cellular autophagy by Anaplasma phagocytophilum.	Anaplasma phagocytophilum, the causative agent of human granulocytic anaplasmosis, is an obligatory intracellular pathogen. After entry into host cells, the bacterium is diverted from the endosomal pathway and replicates in a membrane-bound compartment devoid of endosomal or lysosomal markers. Here, we show that several hallmarks of early autophagosomes can be identified in A. phagocytophilum replicative inclusions, including a double-lipid bilayer membrane and colocalization with GFP-tagged LC3 and Beclin 1, the human homologues of Saccharomyces cerevisiae autophagy-related proteins Atg8 and Atg6 respectively. While the membrane-associated form of LC3, LC3-II, increased during A. phagocytophilum infection, A. phagocytophilum-containing inclusions enveloped with punctate GFP-LC3 did not colocalize with a lysosomal marker. Stimulation of autophagy by rapamycin favoured A. phagocytophilum infection. Inhibition of the autophagosomal pathway by 3-methyladenine did not inhibit A. phagocytophilum internalization, but reversibly arrested its growth. Although autophagy is considered part of the innate immune system that clears a variety of intracellular pathogens, our study implies that A. phagocytophilum subverts this system to establish itself in an early autophagosome-like compartment segregated from lysosomes to facilitate its proliferation.
17980149	Effect of heterodimer partner RXRalpha on PPARgamma activation function-2 helix in solution.	The structural mechanism of allosteric communication between retinoid X receptor (RXR) and its heterodimer partners remains controversial. As a first step towards addressing this question, we report a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) study on the GW1929-bound peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) ligand-binding domain (LBD) with and without the 9-cis-retinoic acid (9cRA)-bound RXRalpha LBD. Sequence-specific 13C(alpha), 13C(beta), and 13CO resonance assignments have been established for over 95% of the 275 residues in the PPARgamma LBD monomer. The 1HN, 15N, and 13CO chemical shift perturbations induced by the RXRalpha LBD binding are located at not only the heterodimer interface that includes the C-terminal residue Y477 but also residues Y473 and K474 in the activation function-2 (AF-2) helix. This result suggests that 9cRA-bound RXRalpha can affect the PPARgamma AF-2 helix in solution and demonstrates that NMR is a powerful new tool for studying the mechanism of allosteric ligand activation in RXR heterodimers.
17980517	Chromosomal high mobility group (HMG) proteins of the HMGB-type occurring in the moss Physcomitrella patens.	High mobility group (HMG) proteins of the HMGB family are chromatin-associated proteins that act as architectural factors in nucleoprotein structures, which regulate DNA-dependent processes including transcription. Members of the HMGB family have been characterised from various mono-and dicot plants, but not from lower plant species. Here, we have identified three candidate HMGB proteins encoded in the genome of the moss Physcomitrella patens. The structurally similar HMGB2 and HMGB3 proteins display the typical overall structure of higher plant HMGB proteins consisting of a central HMG-box DNA-binding domain that is flanked by a basic N-terminal and an acidic C-terminal domain. The HMGB1 protein differs from higher plant HMGB proteins by having a very extensive N-terminal domain and by lacking the acidic C-terminal domain. Like higher plant HMGB proteins, HMGB3 localises to the cell nucleus, but HMGB1 is targeted to plastids. Analysis of the HMG-box domains of HMGB1 and HMGB3 by CD revealed that HMGB1box and the HMGB3box have an alpha-helical structure. While the HMGB3box interacts with DNA comparable to typical higher plant counterparts, the HMGB1box has only a low affinity for DNA. Cotransformation assays in Physcomitrella protoplasts demonstrated that expression of HMGB3 resulted in repression of reporter gene expression. In summary, our data show that functional HMGB-type proteins occur in Physcomitrella and most likely in other lower plant species.
17981336	Synthesis, characterization, DNA-binding and spectral properties of complexes [Ru(L)4(dppz)]2+ (L=Im and MeIm).	Two new Ru(II) complexes [Ru(L)(4)(dppz)](2+) (L=imidazole (Im), 1-methylimidazole (MeIm); dppz=dipyrido[3,2-a:2',3'-c]phenazine), have been synthesized and characterized in detail by elemental analysis, (1)H NMR, Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and UV-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopic techniques. The interaction of these complexes with calf thymus DNA (CT-DNA) has been explored by using electronic absorption titration, competitive binding experiment, circular dichroism (CD), thermal denaturation and viscosity measurements. The experimental results show that: both the two complexes can bind to DNA in an intercalation mode; the DNA-binding affinity of complex [Ru(Im)(4)(dppz)](2+)1 (K(b)=2.5 x 10(6)M(-1)) is greater than that of complex [Ru(MeIm)(4)(dppz)](2+)2 (K(b)=1.1 x 10(6)M(-1)). Moreover, it is very interesting to find that the circular dichroic spectrum of DNA-complex 1 adduct, in which both bands centered at 277 nm and 236 nm are all negative, is very different from those of DNA-complex 2 adduct and other Ru(II) complexes binding to DNA in general intercalation mode. It may be due to the hydrogen-bonding effect or the contribution of induced CD signals of complex 1. Another interesting finding is that the hypochromism of the complexes is not linear relation to their DNA-binding affinities. In order to deeply study these experimental phenomena and trends, the density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) computations were carried out, and on the basis of the DFT/TDDFT results and the frontier molecular orbital theory, the trend in DNA-binding affinities, the spectral properties as well as the interesting phenomena of larger extent of hypochromism but relatively smaller K(b) values for the title complexes have been reasonably explained.
17981341	Dietary administration of sodium alginate and kappa-carrageenan enhances the innate immune response of brown-marbled grouper Epinephelus fuscoguttatus and its resistance against Vibrio alginolyticus.	Brown-marbled grouper Epinephelus fuscoguttatus which had been fed diets containing sodium alginate and kappa (kappa)-carrageenan at 5, 10 and 20gkg(-1), respectively after 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 14 weeks were examined for survival, growth, innate cellular and humoral responses as compared to the fish that fed control non-supplemented diet. Survival was 100% for the fish that fed all diets after 14 weeks and no significant difference in growth was observed among seven diets. The fish that fed a diet containing sodium alginate at 10gkg(-1), and fed a diet containing kappa-carrageenan at 5gkg(-1) over 2-8 weeks showed significantly increased leucocyte count, respiratory burst, phagocytic activity and phagocytic index, The fish that fed a diet containing sodium alginate at 5gkg(-1), and fed a diet containing kappa-carrageenan at 5gkg(-1) over 2-8 weeks showed significantly increased alternative complement activity (ACH50) and lysozyme activity. In another experiment, E. fuscoguttatus, which had been fed control diet, and all diets containing sodium alginate, and kappa-carrageenan after 14 weeks were challenged with Vibrio alginolyticus at 5.0x10(9) colony-forming units (cfu) fish(-1) and then placed in seawater of 34 per thousand. The survival of fish that fed a diet containing sodium alginate at 10gkg(-1) and kappa-carrageenan at 5gkg(-1) was significantly higher than that of fish which fed the control diet over 96-168h. It was concluded that E. fuscoguttatus which fed a diet containing sodium alginate at 10gkg(-1) or less, or fed a diet containing kappa-carrageenan at 5gkg(-1) enhance the innate immunity, and increase the resistance from V. alginolyticus infection.
17981397	Serologic detection of Angiostrongylus vasorum infection in dogs.	Angiostrongylus vasorum, French Heartworm, is a metastrongylid nematode infecting the pulmonary arteries and right heart of wild and domestic canids in various regions of the world. Infection in dogs can result in fatal cardiopulmonary disease. A single endemic focus of A. vasorum in North America occurs in the southeastern portion of Newfoundland, Canada. Dogs are currently diagnosed by detection of first-stage larvae shed in feces using the Baermann technique or fecal flotation. However, these procedures may lack sensitivity due to intermittent fecal larval shedding. The potential for using detection of circulating worm antigen for diagnosis was investigated by developing a sandwich-ELISA using rabbit anti-whole adult worm antiserum. This test detected circulating antigen in sera from 22/24 Baermann positive dogs naturally infected with A. vasorum. Negative results (0/52) were obtained from sera collected from Baermann negative dogs from outside of the endemic region, and from sera (0/30) from dogs from non-endemic regions that were infected with Crenosoma vulpis, the fox lung worm. Receiver operating curve analysis gave a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 92% for the sandwich-ELISA at an optical density cut-off of 0.19. Subsequently, 239 dogs from Newfoundland displaying clinical signs of cardiopulmonary disease, were examined using both the Baermann fecal examination and the sandwich-ELISA. Larvae were detected in 10% (24/239) of these dogs by fecal examination, whereas the sandwich-ELISA detected circulating antigen of A. vasorum in serum from 18.8% (45/239) of the dogs. This suggests that fecal diagnostics may have missed approximately half of the A. vasorum infected dogs, and that the sandwich-ELISA may be a useful tool in the diagnosis of this parasite.
17981545	Inferring regulatory networks.	The discovery of regulatory networks is an important aspect in the post genomic research. The process requires integrated efforts of experimental and computational strategies by employing the systems biology approach. This review summarizes some of the major themes in computational inference of regulatory networks based on gene expression and other data sources, including transcriptional module identification, network topology inference, and network analysis. Popular solutions to each of these problems and their relative merits are discussed.
17981570	The type II transmembrane serine protease matriptase-2--identification, structural features, enzymology, expression pattern and potential roles.	Matriptase-2 (also known as TMPRSS6) is a recently identified member of the type II transmembrane serine protease (TTSP) family. Structurally this enzyme contains a short cytoplasmic amino terminal tail, a transmembrane region, a stem region containing two CUB domains and three LDL receptor class A domains, and at the carboxy terminal a trypsin-like serine protease domain. The matriptase-2 gene and encoded protein are highly conserved in mammals. Biochemically matriptase-2 has substrate specificity similar to the structurally related protein matriptase (also known as MT-SP1). Although the patho-physiological functions of matriptase-2 are not known, its high mRNA expression in liver and several cancers indicate that this enzyme, similar to other TTSPs, will likely have important cell surface associated roles in normal and disease states. Here we overview the identification of matriptase-2, summarise its structural features, biochemistry, expression pattern and disease associations and discuss its potential functions.
17981580	Classification algorithms for phenotype prediction in genomics and proteomics.	This paper gives an overview of statistical and machine learning-based feature selection and pattern classification algorithms and their application in molecular cancer classification or phenotype prediction. In particular, the paper focuses on the use of these computational methods for gene and peak selection from microarray and mass spectrometry data, respectively. The selected features are presented to a classifier for phenotype prediction.
17981601	Chop it, ChIP it, check it: the current status of chromatin immunoprecipitation.	Our understanding of the significance of interactions of proteins with DNA in the context of gene expression, cell differentiation or to some extent disease has immensely been enhanced by the advent of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). ChIP has been widely used to map the localization of post-translationally modified histones or histone variants on the genome or on a specific gene locus, or to map the association of transcription factors or chromatin modifying enzymes to the genome. In spite of its power, ChIP is a cumbersome procedure and typically requires large numbers of cells. This review outlines variations elaborated on the ChIP assay to shorten the procedure, make it suitable for small cell numbers and unravel the multiplicity of histone modifications on a single locus. In addition, the combination of ChIP assays with DNA microarray and high-throughput sequencing technologies has in recent years enabled the profiling of histone modifications and transcription factor occupancy sites throughout the genome and in a high-resolution manner throughout a genomic region of interest. We also review applications of ChIP to the mapping of histone modifications or transcription factor binding at the genome-wide level. Finally, we speculate on future perspectives opened by the combination of emerging ChIP-related technologies.
17981617	Human antibody libraries: a race to engineer and explore a larger diversity.	Several recombinant antibody libraries associated with different screening technologies have been generated since the first steps of antibody engineering 15 years ago, in order to isolate human monoclonal antibodies. In this race to isolate antibody with virtually any specificity, innovative strategies have been developed to clone natural antibody repertoires or to increase library diversity beyond the scope of the immune system. After the in vitro transfer of the natural diversity, the second generation of partly or completely man-designed libraries was based on the available structural data of the antibody binding. Efficient selection strategies have proven critical in exploiting the potential of a library's diversity. The development and improvement of screening methods such as phage display, yeast display, ribosome display and robotic platforms have provided innovative tools to efficiently screen and sort out the desired binding specificities of billions of antibodies. Efforts to improve diversity exploration have been mainly focused on screening conditions of display techniques and the new emerging techniques. Here we review some of these prominent approaches in the field of human recombinant antibody libraries.
17981659	Alternative splicing of U12-type introns.	Precise removal of introns from metazoan precursor mRNAs is critical for gene expression. Nevertheless, alternative splicing provides a means for higher eukaryotes to increase genomic complexity and proteome diversity and to regulate certain cellular functions. The presence of rare U12-type pre-mRNA introns in eukaryotic genomes further complicates splicing events. In this review, we discuss the mechanism of U12-type intron splicing with emphasis on how the U12 spliceosome selects alternative splice sites in various U12-type intron-containing pre-mRNAs. Moreover, we propose possible roles for U12-type introns in a wide range of gene regulation through splicing regulation.
17981746	Dimension reduction and mixed-effects model for microarray meta-analysis of cancer.	The rapid advances in high-throughput microarray technologies greatly facilitate the disease biomarker discovery. However, the potential of these microarray data has not yet been fully utilized. This is partly due to the limited sample sizes of each individual study. Combining microarray data from multiple studies improves the statistical power of detecting differentially expressed genes. Here we present a method for combining the microarray datasets at array probeset level. Using datasets from two commonly used array platforms, the Affymetrix Human Genome U133A and Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 arrays, we found laboratory effects may be more influential than the platform effect. A visualization scheme for merging the array data from different array platforms was proposed to qualitatively judge the degree of agreement between datasets. A mixed-effects model was applied to identify differentially expressed genes from the merged array data.
17981761	The role of signal transducers and activators of transcription in colon cancer.	A family of latent cytoplasmic transcription factors, Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STATs), convey signals from numerous cytokines and growth factors to the nucleus. Their expression and their activity have been shown to be perturbed in a variety of malignancies, including colorectal cancer. Among the STAT family members, oncogenic STAT3 has been shown to be constitutively activated or overexpressed in colon cancers. In contrast, the expression levels of STAT1 have been found to be reduced in transformed intestinal epithelial cells, consistent with tumor suppressor properties of STAT1. We showed that transformation of intestinal epithelial cells with KRasV12 is sufficient to downregulate the expression of STAT1. Because both STAT1 and STAT3 are important regulators of genes that are involved in cell survival (BCL-x, survivin, caspases) and cell proliferation (c-Myc, p21, cyclin D1), their deregulation significantly impacts the homeostasis of intestinal tissues. The critical role of STATs in oncogenesis and in inflammation merits further investigation of targeted inhibitors of STATs activity that could be used alone or in combination with conventional chemotherapy.
17981841	NetworKIN: a resource for exploring cellular phosphorylation networks.	Protein kinases control cellular responses by phosphorylating specific substrates. Recent proteome-wide mapping of protein phosphorylation sites by mass spectrometry has discovered thousands of in vivo sites. Systematically assigning all 518 human kinases to all these sites is a challenging problem. The NetworKIN database (http://networkin.info) integrates consensus substrate motifs with context modelling for improved prediction of cellular kinase-substrate relations. Based on the latest human phosphoproteome from the Phospho.ELM and PhosphoSite databases, the resource offers insight into phosphorylation-modulated interaction networks. Here, we describe how NetworKIN can be used for both global and targeted molecular studies. Via the web interface users can query the database of precomputed kinase-substrate relations or obtain predictions on novel phosphoproteins. The database currently contains a predicted phosphorylation network with 20,224 site-specific interactions involving 3978 phosphoproteins and 73 human kinases from 20 families.
17981843	CTCFBSDB: a CTCF-binding site database for characterization of vertebrate genomic insulators.	Recent studies on transcriptional control of gene expression have pinpointed the importance of long-range interactions and three-dimensional organization of chromatins within the nucleus. Distal regulatory elements such as enhancers may activate transcription over long distances; hence, their action must be restricted within appropriate boundaries to prevent illegitimate activation of non-target genes. Insulators are DNA elements with enhancer-blocking and/or chromatin-bordering functions. In vertebrates, the versatile transcription regulator CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is the only identified trans-acting factor that confers enhancer-blocking insulator activity. CTCF-binding sites were found to be commonly distributed along the vertebrate genomes. We have constructed a CTCF-binding site database (CTCFBSDB) to characterize experimentally identified and computationally predicted CTCF-binding sties. Biological knowledge and data from multiple resources have been integrated into the database, including sequence data, genetic polymorphisms, function annotations, histone methylation profiles, gene expression profiles and comparative genomic information. A web-based user interface was implemented for data retrieval, analysis and visualization. In silico prediction of CTCF-binding motifs is provided to facilitate the identification of candidate insulators in the query sequences submitted by users. The database can be accessed at http://insulatordb.utmem.edu/
17981947	Analysis of fungal flora in indoor dust by ribosomal DNA sequence analysis, quantitative PCR, and culture.	In recent years increasing attention has been given to the potential health effects of fungal exposure in indoor environments. We used large-scale sequencing of the fungal internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) of nuclear ribosomal DNA to describe the mycoflora of two office buildings over the four seasons. DNA sequencing was complemented by cultivation, ergosterol determination, and quantitative PCR analyses. Sequences of 1,339 clones were clustered into 394 nonredundant fungal operational taxonomical units containing sequences from 18 fungal subclasses. The observed flora differed markedly from that recovered by cultivation, the major differences being the near absence of several typical indoor mold genera such as Penicillium and Aspergillus spp. and a high prevalence of basidiomycetes in clone libraries. A total of 55% of the total diversity constituted of unidentifiable ITS sequences, some of which may represent novel fungal species. Dominant species were Cladosporium cladosporioides and C. herbarum, Cryptococcus victoriae, Leptosphaerulina americana and L. chartarum, Aureobasidium pullulans, Thekopsora areolata, Phaeococcomyces nigricans, Macrophoma sp., and several Malassezia species. Seasonal differences were observed for community composition, with ascomycetous molds and basidiomycetous yeasts predominating in the winter and spring and Agaricomycetidae basidiomycetes predominating in the fall. The comparison of methods suggested that the cloning, cultivation, and quantitative PCR methods complemented each other, generating a more comprehensive picture of fungal flora than any of the methods would give alone. The current restrictions of the methods are discussed.
17981981	Autoinducer-2-regulated genes in Streptococcus mutans UA159 and global metabolic effect of the luxS mutation.	Autoinducer 2 (AI-2) is the only species-nonspecific autoinducer known in bacteria and is produced by both gram-negative and gram-positive organisms. Consequently, it is proposed to function as a universal quorum-sensing signal for interaction between bacterial species. AI-2 is produced as the by-product of a metabolic transformation carried out by the LuxS enzyme. To separate the metabolic function of the LuxS enzyme from the signaling role of AI-2, we carried out a global transcriptome analysis of a luxS null mutant culture of Streptococcus mutans UA159, an important cariogenic bacterium and a crucial component of the dental plaque biofilm community, in comparison to a luxS null mutant culture supplemented with chemically pure 4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione, the precursor of AI-2. The data revealed fundamental changes in gene expression affecting 585 genes (30% of the genome) which could not be restored by the signal molecule AI-2 and are therefore not caused by quorum sensing but by lack of the transformation carried out by the LuxS enzyme in the activated methyl cycle. All functional classes of enzymes were affected, including genes known to be important for biofilm formation, bacteriocin synthesis, competence, and acid tolerance. At the same time, 59 genes were identified whose transcription clearly responded to the addition of AI-2. Some of them were related to protein synthesis, stress, and cell division. Three membrane transport proteins were upregulated which are not related to any of the known AI-2 transporters. Three transcription factors were identified whose transcription was stimulated repeatedly by AI-2 addition during growth. Finally, a global regulatory protein, the delta subunit of the RNA polymerase (rpoE), was induced 147-fold by AI-2, representing the largest differential gene expression observed. The data show that many phenotypes related to the luxS mutation cannot be ascribed to quorum sensing and have identified for the first time regulatory proteins potentially mediating AI-2-based signaling in gram-positive bacteria.
17982171	Upgrades to StellaBase facilitate medical and genetic studies on the starlet sea anemone, Nematostella vectensis.	The starlet sea anemone, Nematostella vectensis, is a basal metazoan organism that has recently emerged as an important model system in developmental biology and evolutionary genomics. StellaBase, the Nematostella Genomics Database (http://stellabase.org), was developed in 2005 as a resource to support the Nematostella research community. Recently, it has become apparent that Nematostella may be a particularly useful system for studying (i) microevolutionary variation in natural populations, and (ii) the functional evolution of human disease genes. We have developed two new databases that will foster such studies: StellaBase Disease (http://stellabase.org/disease) is a relational database that houses 155 904 invertebrate homologous isoforms of human disease genes from four leading genomic model systems (fly, worm, yeast and Nematostella), including 14 874 predicted genes from the sea anemone itself. StellaBase SNP (http://stellabase.org/SNP) is a relational database that describes the location and underlying type of mutation for 20 063 single nucleotide polymorphisms.
17982707	Frequency of HLA-B27 alleles in Brazilian patients with psoriatic arthritis.	This prospective study analyzed the frequency of HLA-B27 and its alleles in 102 Brazilian patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA). The association of the HLA-B27 alleles with these variants was compared to a control healthy HLA-B27 positive group of 111 individuals. There was a predominance of male gender (59.8%), Caucasian race (89.2%), and negative HLA-B27 (79.4%) patients. Asymmetric oligoarthritis (62.7%) was the most frequently observed clinical PsA subgroup, followed by spondylitis (16.7%), and polyarthritis (15.7%). Male gender and the spondylitis subgroup were statistically associated to the positive HLA-B27, and the oligoarthritis subgroup was associated to the negative HLA-B27. Among the 21 HLA-B27-positive PsA patients, there was a significant prevalence of the HLA-B*2705 allele (90.5%), similar to that observed in the control group (80.2%); HLA-B*2703 and HLA-B*2707 were statistically associated to the control group.
17982713	Blue light diminishes interaction of PAS/LOV proteins, putative blue light receptors in Arabidopsis thaliana, with their interacting partners.	The light, oxygen, or voltage (LOV) domain that belongs to the Per-ARNT-Sim (PAS) domain superfamily is a blue light sensory module. The Arabidopsis thaliana PAS/LOV PROTEIN (PLP) gene encodes three putative blue light receptor proteins, PLPA, PLPB, and PLPC, because of its mRNA splicing variation. PLPA and PLPB each contain one PAS domain at the N-terminal region and one LOV domain at the C-terminal region, while the LOV domain is truncated in PLPC. RNA gel blot analysis showed that PLP mRNA was markedly expressed after exposure to salt or dehydration stress. Yeast two-hybrid screening led to the isolation of VITAMIN C DEFECTIVE 2 (VTC2), VTC2-LIKE (VTC2L), and BEL1-LIKE HOMEODOMAIN 10 proteins (BLH10A and BLH10B) as PLP-interacting proteins. The molecular interaction of PLPA with VTC2L, BLH10A or BLH10B, and that of PLPB with VTC2L were diminished when yeasts were grown under blue light illumination. Furthermore, the possible binding of flavin chromophore to PLPA and PLPB was demonstrated. These results imply that the LOV domain of PLPA and PLPB functions as a blue light sensor, and suggest the applicability of these interactions to blue light-dependent switching in transcriptional regulation in yeast or other organisms.
17983627	Steinernema cholashanense n. sp. (Rhabditida, Steinernematidae) a new species of entomopathogenic nematode from the province of Sichuan, Chola Shan Mountains, China.	During a random survey of entomopathogenic nematodes in the provinces of Sichuan and Gansu (eastern Tibet) in 2004, soil samples from several sites were collected and tested for the incidence of entomopathogenic nematodes. A new species was collected in this survey and it is described herein as Steinernema cholashanense n. sp. Steinernema cholashanense n. sp. is characterized by morphology and morphometry of the IJ and male. For the IJ, the new species can be recognized by the average body length 843 microm, esophagus length 125 microm, H%=39% and E%=81%. The lateral field pattern is 2, 5, 7, 4, 2. The male of the first generation is characterized by spicule shape and length and especially with prominent velum and the presence of a mucron on both generations. The average body length of the IJ of S. cholashanense n. sp. (843 microm) is shorter than that of S. oregonense (980 microm), S. kraussei (951 microm) and S. litorale (909 microm), similar to that of S. feltiae (849 microm), but longer than that of S. weiseri (740 microm), S. jollietti (711 microm) and S. hebeiense (658 microm). Esophagus length of the new species (125 microm) is closer to that of S. jollieti (123 microm) but longer than that of S. weiseri (113 microm) and shorter than that of S. oregonense (132 microm), S. kraussei (134 microm) and S. feltiae (136 microm). E% of the new species (81) is similar to that of S. kraussei (80), but smaller than that of S. jollieti (88), S. weiseri (95), S. oregonense (100) and S. feltiae (119). Spicule head length of the new species is almost the same as its width, this character is similar to that of S. kraussei but it is different from this species by its prominent velum. The new species can be recognized further by characteristics of sequences of ITS and D2D3 regions and cross hybridization with closely related species, S. feltiae, S. kraussei and S. oregonense.
17983681	Renal manifestations of metabolic syndrome in type 2 diabetes.	AIM: The association between metabolic syndrome (MS) and renal outcomes in diabetic patients remains unclear. We conducted a cross-sectional study to assess the association between MS and albuminuria and decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in type 2 diabetic patients. METHODS: We studied a total of 1003 adult Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes, 582 men, with a mean (+/-S.D.) age of 62+/-12 years. Patients with macroalbuminuria, defined as a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) > or =300 mg/g Cr, and those with renal insufficiency, defined as serum creatinine > or =2.0 mg/dl, were excluded. MS was assessed according to Japanese definition proposed in 2005. Microalbuminuria and decreased GFR were defined as ACR of 30-299 mg/g Cr and estimated GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m(2), respectively. RESULTS: The prevalence of microalbuminuria was significantly higher in patients with MS than those without. In contrast, the prevalence of decreased GFR was comparable between patients with and without MS. Waist circumference was selected as a significant variable in the logistic regression analysis for microalbuminuria. CONCLUSION: Microalbuminuria, but not decreased GFR, is independently associated with MS and solely with increased waist circumference in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes.
17983756	Novel 2-phenylquinolin-7-yl-derived imidazo[1,5-a]pyrazines as potent insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) inhibitors.	A series of novel, potent quinolinyl-derived imidazo[1,5-a]pyrazine IGF-IR (IGF-1R) inhibitors--most notably, cis-3-(3-azetidin-1-ylmethylcyclobutyl)-1-(2-phenylquinolin-7-yl)imidazo[1,5-a]pyrazin-8-ylamine (AQIP)--is described. Synthetic details, structure-activity relationships, and in vitro biological activity are reported for the series. Key in vitro and in vivo biological results for AQIP are reported, including: inhibition of ligand-stimulated autophosphorylation of IGF-IR and downstream pathways in 3T3/huIGFIR cells; inhibition of proliferation and induction of DNA fragmentation in human tumor cell lines; a pharmacokinetic profile suitable for once-per-day oral dosing; antitumor activity in a 3T3/huIGFIR xenograft model; and effects on insulin and glucose levels.
17983848	Intrinsic 5'-deoxyribose-5-phosphate lyase activity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Trf4 protein with a possible role in base excision DNA repair.	In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the base excision DNA repair (BER) pathway has been thought to involve only a multinucleotide (long-patch) mechanism (LP-BER), in contrast to most known cases that include a major single-nucleotide pathway (SN-BER). The key step in mammalian SN-BER, removal of the 5'-terminal abasic residue generated by AP endonuclease incision, is effected by DNA polymerase beta (Polbeta). Computational analysis indicates that yeast Trf4 protein, with roles in sister chromatin cohesion and RNA quality control, is a new member of the X family of DNA polymerases that includes Polbeta. Previous studies of yeast trf4Delta mutants revealed hypersensitivity to methylmethane sulfonate (MMS) but not UV light, a characteristic of BER mutants in other organisms. We found that, like mammalian Polbeta, Trf4 is able to form a Schiff base intermediate with a 5'-deoxyribose-5-phosphate substrate and to excise the abasic residue through a dRP lyase activity. Also like Polbeta, Trf4 forms stable cross-links in vitro to 5'-incised 2-deoxyribonolactone residues in DNA. We determined the sensitivity to MMS of strains with a trf4Delta mutation in a rad27Delta background, in an AP lyase-deficient background (ogg1 ntg1 ntg2), or in a pol4Delta background. Only a RAD27 genetic interaction was detected: there was higher sensitivity for strains mutated in both TRF4 and RAD27 than either single mutant, and overexpression of Trf4 in a rad27Delta background partially suppressed MMS sensitivity. The data strongly suggest a role for Trf4 in a pathway parallel to the Rad27-dependent LP-BER in yeast. Finally, we demonstrate that Trf5 significantly affects MMS sensitivity and thus probably BER efficiency in cells expressing either wild-type Trf4 or a C-terminus-deleted form.
17984070	Mismatch Repair proteins are recruited to replicating DNA through interaction with Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA).	Mismatch Repair (MMR) is closely linked to DNA replication; however, other than the role of the replicative sliding clamp (PCNA) in various MMR functions, the linkage between DNA replication and MMR has been difficult to investigate. Here we use an in vitro DNA replication system based on simian virus 40, to investigate MMR recruitment to replicating DNA. Both DNA replication and MMR proteins are recruited to replicating DNA in an origin-dependent fashion. Primer synthesis is required for recruitment of both PCNA and MMR proteins, but not for recruitment of the single-stranded DNA-binding protein (RPA). Blocking PCNA recruitment to replicating DNA with a p21-based polypeptide blocks PCNA and MMR, but not RPA recruitment. Once PCNA and subsequent proteins required for replication are loaded onto DNA, addition of p21 leaves PCNA on the replicating DNA, but actively displaces MMR proteins. These findings indicate that the MMR machinery is recruited to replicating DNA through its interaction with PCNA, and suggests that this occurs via binding of the MMR proteins to the multi-protein interaction sites on PCNA. These studies demonstrate the utility of this system for further investigation of the role of DNA replication in MMR.
17984086	PhosPhAt: a database of phosphorylation sites in Arabidopsis thaliana and a plant-specific phosphorylation site predictor.	The PhosPhAt database provides a resource consolidating our current knowledge of mass spectrometry-based identified phosphorylation sites in Arabidopsis and combines it with phosphorylation site prediction specifically trained on experimentally identified Arabidopsis phosphorylation motifs. The database currently contains 1187 unique tryptic peptide sequences encompassing 1053 Arabidopsis proteins. Among the characterized phosphorylation sites, there are over 1000 with unambiguous site assignments, and nearly 500 for which the precise phosphorylation site could not be determined. The database is searchable by protein accession number, physical peptide characteristics, as well as by experimental conditions (tissue sampled, phosphopeptide enrichment method). For each protein, a phosphorylation site overview is presented in tabular form with detailed information on each identified phosphopeptide. We have utilized a set of 802 experimentally validated serine phosphorylation sites to develop a method for prediction of serine phosphorylation (pSer) in Arabidopsis. An analysis of the current annotated Arabidopsis proteome yielded in 27,782 predicted phosphoserine sites distributed across 17,035 proteins. These prediction results are summarized graphically in the database together with the experimental phosphorylation sites in a whole sequence context. The Arabidopsis Protein Phosphorylation Site Database (PhosPhAt) provides a valuable resource to the plant science community and can be accessed through the following link http://phosphat.mpimp-golm.mpg.de.
17984221	Proline-rich transcript in brain protein induces stress granule formation.	The repression of translation in environmentally stressed eukaryotic cells causes the sequestration of translation initiation factors and the 40S ribosomal subunit into discrete cytoplasmic foci called stress granules (SGs). Most components of the preinitiation complex, such as eIF3, eIF4A, eIF4E, eIF4G, and poly(A)-binding protein, congregate into SGs under stress conditions. However, the molecular basis of translation factor sequestration into SGs has not been clearly elucidated. Here, we report that proline-rich transcript in brain (PRTB) protein interacts with eIF4G and participates in SG formation. PRTB was recruited to SG under sodium arsenite and heat stress conditions. When overexpressed, PRTB inhibited global translation and formed SGs containing TIA-1, eIF4G, and eIF3. Knockdown of PRTB reduced the SG formation induced by sodium arsenite. These results suggest that PRTB not only is a component of SG formed by cellular stresses but also plays an important role in SG formation via an interaction with the scaffold protein eIF4G, which is associated with many translation factors and mRNAs.
17985115	Role of sigma54 in the regulation of genes involved in type I and type IV pili biogenesis in Xylella fastidiosa.	The phytopathogen Xylella fastidiosa produces long type IV pili and short type I pili involved in motility and adhesion. In this work, we have investigated the role of sigma factor sigma(54) (RpoN) in the regulation of fimbrial biogenesis in X. fastidiosa. An rpoN null mutant was constructed from the non-pathogenic citrus strain J1a12, and microarray analyses of global gene expression comparing the wild type and rpoN mutant strains showed few genes exhibiting differential expression. In particular, gene pilA1 (XF2542), which encodes the structural pilin protein of type IV pili, showed decreased expression in the rpoN mutant, whereas two-fold higher expression of an operon encoding proteins of type I pili was detected, as confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis. The transcriptional start site of pilA1 was determined by primer extension, downstream of a sigma(54)-dependent promoter. Microarray and qRT-PCR data demonstrated that expression of only one of the five pilA paralogues, pilA1, was significantly reduced in the rpoN mutant. The rpoN mutant made more biofilm than the wild type strain and presented a cell-cell aggregative phenotype. These results indicate that sigma(54) differentially regulates genes involved in type IV and type I fimbrial biogenesis, and is involved in biofilm formation in X. fastidiosa.
17985157	Mollusc grazing limits growth and early development of the old forest lichen Lobaria pulmonaria in broadleaved deciduous forests.	THIS STUDY AIMS: (1) to quantify mollusc grazing on juvenile and mature thalli of the foliose epiphytic lichen Lobaria pulmonaria, and (2) to test the hypothesis inferring a herbivore defensive role of lichen depsidones in forests with indigenous populations of lichen-feeding molluscs. Lichens were transplanted in shaded and less shaded positions in each of two calcareous broadleaved deciduous forests, one poor in lichens, one with a rich Lobarion community. Preventing the access of molluscs significantly reduced the loss of juvenile L. pulmonaria, particularly in the naturally lichen-poor forest. Molluscs also severely grazed mature thalli in the lichen-poor forest, especially thalli placed under the more shading canopies. Furthermore, reducing the natural concentration of depsidones by pre-rinsing with acetone increased subsequent grazing significantly, showing that lichen depsidones function as herbivore defence in natural habitats. Our results suggest that mollusc grazing may play important roles in shaping the epiphytic vegetation in calcareous deciduous forests, and that recently established juvenile L. pulmonaria thalli seem to be particularly vulnerable.
17986452	LOCATE: a mammalian protein subcellular localization database.	LOCATE is a curated, web-accessible database that houses data describing the membrane organization and subcellular localization of mouse and human proteins. Over the past 2 years, the data in LOCATE have grown substantially. The database now contains high-quality localization data for 20% of the mouse proteome and general localization annotation for nearly 36% of the mouse proteome. The proteome annotated in LOCATE is from the RIKEN FANTOM Consortium Isoform Protein Sequence sets which contains 58 128 mouse and 64 637 human protein isoforms. Other additions include computational subcellular localization predictions, automated computational classification of experimental localization image data, prediction of protein sorting signals and third party submission of literature data. Collectively, this database provides localization proteome for individual subcellular compartments that will underpin future systematic investigations of these regions. It is available at http://locate.imb.uq.edu.au/
17986521	An ENU-induced mutation in the Ankrd11 gene results in an osteopenia-like phenotype in the mouse mutant Yoda.	The mechanisms that regulate bone mass are important in a variety of complex diseases such as osteopenia and osteoporosis. Regulation of bone mass is a polygenic trait and is also influenced by various environmental and lifestyle factors, making analysis of the genetic basis difficult. As an effort toward identifying novel genes involved in regulation of bone mass, N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis in mice has been utilized. Here we describe a mouse mutant termed Yoda that was identified in an ENU mutagenesis screen for dominantly acting mutations. Mice heterozygous for the Yoda mutation exhibit craniofacial abnormalities: shortened snouts, wider skulls, and deformed nasal bones, underlined by altered morphology of frontonasal sutures and failure of interfrontal suture to close. A major feature of the mutant is reduced bone mineral density. Homozygosity for the mutation results in embryonic lethality. Positional cloning of the locus identified a missense mutation in a highly conserved region of the ankyrin repeat domain 11 gene (Ankrd11). This gene has not been previously associated with bone metabolism and, thus, identifies a novel genetic regulator of bone homeostasis.
17987044	Epidermal homeostasis: do committed progenitors work while stem cells sleep?	Tracking the fate of cells in murine epidermis in vivo has revealed that a committed progenitor cell population can maintain normal adult tissue in the long term without support from a long-lived, self-renewing population of stem cells. Here, we argue that these results challenge the dogma that stem-cell proliferation is required for the cellular homeostasis of the epidermis and other adult tissues, with important implications for tissue physiology and disease.
17987060	Individual differences in nicotine dependence, withdrawal symptoms, and sex predict transient fMRI-BOLD responses to smoking cues.	Exposure to smoking cues increases craving for cigarettes and can precipitate relapse. Whereas brain imaging studies have identified a distinct network of brain regions subserving the processing of smoking cues, little is known about the influence of individual difference factors and withdrawal symptoms on brain cue reactivity. Multiple regression analysis was used to evaluate relations between individual difference factors and withdrawal symptoms and event-related blood oxygen level-dependent responses to visual smoking cues in a sample of 30 smokers. Predictors were self-report nicotine dependence (Fagerström test of nicotine dependence, FTND), prescan withdrawal symptoms (craving and negative affect), and sex. The unique variance of each predictor was examined after controlling for each of the others. Positive associations were observed between FTND and reactivity to cues in right anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) whereas negative associations were observed between prescan craving and reactivity in ventral striatum. Higher negative affect or being male was associated with greater reactivity in left hippocampus and left OFC. Women exhibited greater cue reactivity than men in regions including the cuneus and left superior temporal gyrus. Individual difference factors and withdrawal symptoms were uniquely associated with brain reactivity to smoking cues in regions subserving reward, affect, attention, motivation, and memory. These findings provide further evidence that reactivity to conditioned drug cues is multiply determined and suggest that smoking cessation treatments designed to reduce cue reactivity focus on each of these variables.
17987313	Xyloglucan-pectin linkages are formed intra-protoplasmically, contribute to wall-assembly, and remain stable in the cell wall.	We tested two hypotheses for the mechanism by which xyloglucan-pectin covalent bonds are formed in Arabidopsis cell cultures. Hypothesis 1 proposed hetero-transglycosylation, with xyloglucan as donor substrate and a rhamnogalacturonan-I (RG-I) side-chain as acceptor. We looked for enzyme activities that catalyse this reaction using alpha-(1-->5)-L-[(3)H]arabino- or beta-(1-->4)-D-[(3)H]galacto-oligosaccharides as model acceptor substrates. The (3)H-oligosaccharides were supplied (with or without added xyloglucans) to living Arabidopsis cell-cultures, permeabilised cells, cell-free extracts, or four authentic XTHs. No hetero-transglycosylation occurred. Therefore, we cannot support hypothesis 1. Hypothesis 2 proposed that some xyloglucan is manufactured de novo as a side-chain on RG-I. To test this, we pulse-labelled Arabidopsis cell-cultures with [(3)H]arabinose and monitored the radiolabelling of anionic (pectin-bonded) xyloglucan, which was resolved from free xyloglucan by ion-exchange chromatography. [(3)H]Xyloglucan-pectin complexes were detectable <4 min after [(3)H]arabinose feeding, which is shorter than the transit-time for polysaccharide secretion, indicating that xyloglucan-pectin bonds were formed intra-protoplasmically. Thereafter, the proportion of the wall-bound [(3)H]xyloglucan that was anionic remained almost constant at approximately 50% for > or =6 days, showing that the xyloglucan-pectin bond was stable in vivo. Some [(3)H]xyloglucan was rapidly sloughed into the medium instead of becoming wall-bound. Only approximately 30% of the sloughed [(3)H]xyloglucan was anionic, indicating that bonding to pectin promoted the integration of xyloglucan into the wall. We conclude that approximately 50% of xyloglucan in cultured Arabidopsis cells is synthesised on a pectic primer, then secreted into the apoplast, where the xyloglucan-pectin bonds are stable and the pectic moiety aids wall-assembly.
17987340	Cetuximab shows activity in colorectal cancer patients with tumors for which FISH analysis does not detect an increase in EGFR gene copy number.	BACKGROUND: EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) gene gain assessed by FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) has been shown to be predictive of response to EGFR-targeted therapies in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. The aim or our study was to relate the EGFR gene copy number to therapeutic results in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) treated with a cetuximab-containing regimen. METHODS: Forty-seven patients with metastatic CRC treated with a cetuximab-containing regimen between August 2004 and September 2006 were included in our study. EGFR status was assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and by FISH on fixed paraffin-embedded sections of tumor specimens. RESULTS: By IHC (n = 47), 39 patients (83%) had EGFR-positive tumors. EGFR gene copy gain was detected in 8 (19.5%) of 41 tumors. Neither EGFR expression assessed by IHC nor EGFR gene copy gain assessed by FISH were statistically significantly correlated with objective response rate, disease control rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival. Of the 33 patients whose tumors were FISH negative, 8 patients (24.2%) had a partial response, and 10 (30.3%) had stable disease. CONCLUSIONS: EGFR FISH analysis does not seem to be a sufficiently robust test for selecting candidate CRC patients for cetuximab therapy.
17988219	A picky eater: exploring the mechanisms of selective autophagy in human pathologies.	Autophagy is a catabolic process conserved among all eukaryotes essential for the cellular and organismal homeostasis. One of the principal roles of this pathway is to maintain an accurate balance between synthesis, degradation and subsequent recycling of cellular components. Under certain conditions, however, cells are also able to modulate autophagy and specifically remove a number of structures that are potentially harmful. Aberrant protein aggregates, damaged organelles or pathogens can be selectively incorporated into large double-membrane vesicles called autophagosomes to be delivered into lysosomes for destruction. This ability to eliminate specific structures is exploited by the cells in several physiological processes as well as in multiple pathological situations, making autophagy a precious multitask cellular degradative pathway. In this review, we will first examine what is known about the basic mechanisms of autophagy and then discuss in a second part the nature of the cargoes that are selectively sequestered into autophagosomes, what provides the specificity and the possible implications of selective types of autophagy in human pathologies.
17988719	Groundwater nitrogen composition and transformation within a moorland catchment, mid-Wales.	The importance of upland groundwater systems in providing a medium for nitrogen transformations and processes along flow paths is investigated within the Afon Gwy moorland catchment, Plynlimon, mid-Wales. Dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) was found to be the most abundant form of dissolved nitrogen (N) in most soils and groundwaters, accounting for between 47 and 72% of total dissolved nitrogen in shallow groundwater samples and up to 80% in deeper groundwaters. Groundwater DON may also be an important source of bio-available N in surface waters and marine systems fed by upland catchments. A conceptual model of N processes is proposed based on a detailed study along a transect of nested boreholes and soil suction samplers within the interfluve zone. Shallow groundwater N speciation reflects the soilwater N speciation implying a rapid transport mechanism and good connectivity between the soil and groundwater systems. Median nitrate concentrations were an order of magnitude lower within the soil zone (<5-31 microg/L) than in the shallow groundwaters (86-746 microg/L). Given the rapid hydrostatic response of the groundwater level within the soil zone, the shallow groundwater system is both a source and sink for dissolved N. Results from dissolved N(2)O, N(2)/Ar ratios and dissolved N chemistry suggests that microbial N transformations (denitrification and nitrification) may play an important role in controlling the spatial variation in soil and groundwater N speciation. Reducing conditions within the groundwater and saturated soils of the wet-flush zones on the lower hillslopes, a result of relatively impermeable drift deposits, are also important in controlling N speciation and transformation processes.
17988963	Molecular structure and regulation of phototropin kinase by blue light.	Phototropin (phot) is a blue light photoreceptor in plants that mediates phototropism, chloroplast movement, stomata opening and leaf expansion. The phot molecule has two photoreceptive domains, LOV 1 and 2, in the N-terminal half and the C-terminal half forms Ser/Thr kinase. Phot acts as a blue light-regulated protein kinase. Each LOV domain binds a FMN and undergoes a unique cyclic reaction upon blue light absorption that induces conformational changes in the protein moiety and leads to regulation of the kinase activity, in which LOV2 plays a predominant role in the switching and LOV1 acts to attenuate the light sensitivity. Phot kinase is classified into the AGC kinase group since the consensus amino acid residues and the motifs are well conserved except for the lack of the hydrophobic motif and the presence of additional amino acid sequence in the activation loop. Secondary structure prediction and 3D structure simulation show a alpha/beta fold of the phot kinase similar to that of the catalytic subunit of PKA. The additional sequence forms an extra helix and loops. Docking simulation of the LOV2 domain with phot kinase provided useful information regarding the molecular mechanism underlying the photoregulation of phot kinase.
17989070	Comparison of conditions for cryopreservation of testicular tissue from immature mice.	BACKGROUND: Cryopreservation of immature testicular tissue could be considered as a major step in fertility preservation for young boys with cancer. In the present study, eight different freezing protocols were evaluated in immature mice testis. METHODS: Testis from six-day-old mice were frozen using either 1,2-propanediol (PROH) or dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO: D) at 1.5 M. Different cooling rate curves were tested: (i) controlled slow protocol with seeding (CS+) or (ii) without seeding (CS-), (iii) controlled rapid protocol and (iv) non-controlled protocol. Cryodamage of seminiferous cords was semi-quantitatively determined, establishing a scoring of alterations. Cell viability and apoptosis induction were assessed on testicular cell suspensions immediately after digestion (D0) and after a 20-h culture period (D1). Cells recovered after digestion of 100 mg tissue and the rate of living and non-apoptotic cells were quantified at D0 and D1. A long-term culture (9 days) of testis pieces was carried out for the protocol offering the best survival. Testosterone production, intratubular cell proliferation and tubule growth were assessed. RESULTS: DMSO produced optimal results in the different cooling rate curves tested when compared with PROH. Optimal results were obtained for the DCS- procedure (P < 0.05). Testosterone production, tubule growth and cell proliferation of post-thaw pieces were similar to fresh samples. CONCLUSIONS: Testis freezing with 1.5 M DMSO in a CS- procedure was found to maintain not only immature testicular tissue architecture, but also viability of testicular cells, endocrine and partial exocrine functions of the testis. Semi-quantitative evaluation of seminiferous cord cryodamage can be effectively used to rapidly screen optimal freezing conditions and as a possible quality control in a human application.
17989125	Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/akt and ras/raf-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway mutations in anaplastic thyroid cancer.	CONTEXT: Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) can occur in the setting of differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC), which suggests a continuum in malignant progression from DTC to ATC. The Ras/Raf-MAPK and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathways play critical roles in DTC tumorigenesis, but their roles in the pathogenesis of ATC are poorly defined. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to explore the potential contributions of these two pathways in ATC pathogenesis. DESIGN, SETTING, AND SUBJECTS: The mutational status of BRAF, PIK3CA, PTEN, and RAS genes was analyzed in genomic DNA from microdissected tumor specimens of 36 cases of ATC, and in 16 samples of paired-matched lymph node metastases. PIK3CA copy number gain was assessed by real-time quantitative PCR. We performed immunohistochemistry for phospho-ERK and phospho-AKT in 26 cases of ATC. RESULTS: DTC was present in half of the cases. BRAF V600E mutation was identified in nine of 36 (25%) ATCs; seven cases had identical mutations in both the ATC and DTC components. PIK3CA kinase domain mutations were found in five (14%) ATCs, one of which had mutations in both differentiated and anaplastic areas. RAS and PTEN mutations were each found in two (6%) ATCs. PIK3CA gain copy number was found notably increased in 14 (39%) ATCs. CONCLUSIONS: BRAF mutations appear to play a role in the tumorigenesis of a subset of ATCs, and the majority of lymph node metastases. PIK3CA alterations occur preferentially in the later stages of ATC and were the most relevant events during thyroid cancer progression. The activation of both pathways suggests an important role in ATC dedifferentiation.
17989240	Development of thalamocortical response transformations in the rat whisker-barrel system.	Extracellular single-unit recordings were used to characterize responses of thalamic barreloid and cortical barrel neurons to controlled whisker deflections in 2, 3-, and 4-wk-old and adult rats in vivo under fentanyl analgesia. Results indicate that response properties of thalamic and cortical neurons diverge during development. Responses to deflection onsets and offsets among thalamic neurons mature in parallel, whereas among cortical neurons responses to deflection offsets become disproportionately smaller with age. Thalamic neuron receptive fields become more multiwhisker, whereas those of cortical neurons become more single-whisker. Thalamic neurons develop a higher degree of angular selectivity, whereas that of cortical neurons remains constant. In the temporal domain, response latencies decrease both in thalamic and cortical neurons, but the maturation time-course differs between the two populations. Response latencies of thalamic cells decrease primarily between 2 and 3 wk of life, whereas response latencies of cortical neurons decrease in two distinct steps--the first between 2 and 3 wk of life and the second between the fourth postnatal week and adulthood. Although the first step likely reflects similar subcortical changes, the second phase likely corresponds to developmental myelination of thalamocortical fibers. Divergent development of thalamic and cortical response properties indicates that thalamocortical circuits in the whisker-to-barrel pathway undergo protracted maturation after 2 wk of life and provides a potential substrate for experience-dependent plasticity during this time.
17989582	Endoscopic anatomy of the pterygopalatine fossa and the transpterygoid approach: development of a surgical instruction model.	INTRODUCTION: The pterygopalatine fossa (PPF) is a narrow space located between the posterior wall of the antrum and the pterygoid plates. Surgical access to the PPF is difficult because of its protected position and its complex neurovascular anatomy. Endonasal approaches using rod lens endoscopes, however, provide better visualization of this area and are associated with less morbidity than external approaches. Our aim was to develop a simple anatomical model using cadaveric specimens injected with intravascular colored silicone to demonstrate the endoscopic anatomy of the PPF. This model could be used for surgical instruction of the transpterygoid approach. METHODS: We dissected six PPF in three cadaveric specimens prepared with intravascular injection of colored material using two different injection techniques. An endoscopic endonasal approach, including a wide nasoantral window and removal of the posterior antrum wall, provided access to the PPF. RESULTS: We produced our best anatomical model injecting colored silicone via the common carotid artery. We found that, using an endoscopic approach, a retrograde dissection of the sphenopalatine artery helped to identify the internal maxillary artery (IMA) and its branches. Neural structures were identified deeper to the vascular elements. Notable anatomical landmarks for the endoscopic surgeon are the vidian nerve and its canal that leads to the petrous portion of the internal carotid artery (ICA), and the foramen rotundum, and V2 that leads to Meckel's cave in the middle cranial fossa. These two nerves, vidian and V2, are separated by a pyramidal shaped bone and its apex marks the ICA. CONCLUSION: Our anatomical model provides the means to learn the endoscopic anatomy of the PPF and may be used for the simulation of surgical techniques. An endoscopic endonasal approach provides adequate exposure to all anatomical structures within the PPF. These structures may be used as landmarks to identify and control deeper neurovascular structures. The significance is that an anatomical model facilitates learning the surgical anatomy and the acquisition of surgical skills. A dissection superficial to the vascular structures preserves the neural elements. These nerves and their bony foramina, such as the vidian nerve and V2, are critical anatomical landmarks to identify and control the ICA at the skull base.
17989994	SBP-domain transcription factors as possible effectors of cryptochrome-mediated blue light signalling in the moss Physcomitrella patens.	Cryptochromes are blue light absorbing photoreceptors found in many organisms and involved in numerous developmental processes. At least two highly similar cryptochromes are known to affect branching during gametophytic development in the moss Physcomitrella patens. We uncovered a relationship between these cryptochromes and the expression of particular members of the SBP-box genes, a plant specific transcription factor family. Transcript levels of the respective moss SBP-box genes, all belonging to the LG1-subfamily, were found to be dependent, albeit not exclusively, on blue light. Moreover, disruptant lines generated for two moss representatives of this SBP-box gene subfamily, both showed enhanced caulonema side branch formation, a phenotype opposite to that of the ppcry1a/1b double disruptant line. In this report we show that PpCRY1a and PpCRY1b act negatively on the transcript levels of several related moss SBP-box genes and that at least PpSBP1 and PpSBP4 act as negative regulators of side branch formation.
17990100	Brain metastases in breast cancer: prognostic factors and management.	BACKGROUND: The purpose of this retrospective study was to analyze the overall survival of patients with brain metastases due to breast cancer and to identify prognostic factors that affect clinical outcome. METHODS: Of the 7,872 breast cancer patients histologically diagnosed with breast cancer between January 1990 and July 2006 at the Asan Medical Center, 198 patients with solitary or multiple brain metastases were included in this retrospective study. Central nervous system (CNS) lesions were diagnosed by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Patients with leptomeningeal or dural metastases without co-existent parenchymal metastatic lesions were excluded in this study. We reviewed the medical records and pathologic data of these 198 patients to characterize the clinical features and outcomes. RESULTS: The median age of the patients at the diagnosis of brain metastases was 45 years (range 26-78 years). Fifty-five patients (28%) had a single brain metastasis, whereas 143 (72%) had more than two metastases. A total of 157 (79.2%) patients received whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT). A total of 7 (3.6%) patients underwent resection of solitary brain metastases, 22 (11%) patients underwent gamma-knife surgery, three patients underwent intrathecal chemotherapy (1.5%) and 9 (4.6%) patients received no treatment. The overall median survival time was 5.6 months (95% confidence interval (CI), 4.7-6.5 months) and 23.1% of the patients survived for more than 1 year. The median overall survival time was 5.4 months for patients treated with WBRT, 14.9 months for patients treated with surgery or gamma-knife surgery only, and 2.1 months for patients who received no treatment (P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (relative risk (RR) = 0.704, 95% CI 0.482-1.028, P = 0.069), number of brain metastases (RR = 0.682, 95% CI 0.459-1.014, P = 0.058), treatment modalities (RR = 1.686, 95% CI 1.022-2.781, P = 0.041), and systemic chemotherapy after brain metastases (RR = 1.871, 95% CI 1.353-2.586, P < 0.001) were independent factors associated with survival. CONCLUSION: Although survival of breast cancer patients with brain metastases was generally short, the performance status, number of brain metastases, treatment modalities and systemic chemotherapy after brain metastases were significantly associated with survival. Patients with single-brain metastasis and good performance status deserve aggressive treatment. The characteristics of initial primary breast lesions did not affect survival after brain metastasis.
17990271	Histogenetic compartments of the mouse centromedial and extended amygdala based on gene expression patterns during development.	The amygdala controls emotional and social behavior and regulates instinctive reflexes such as defense and reproduction by way of descending projections to the hypothalamus and brainstem. The descending amygdalar projections are suggested to show a cortico-striato-pallidal organization similar to that of the basal ganglia (Swanson [2000] Brain Res 886:113-164). To test this model we investigated the embryological origin and molecular properties of the mouse centromedial and extended amygdalar subdivisions, which constitute major sources of descending projections. We analyzed the distribution of key regulatory genes that show restricted expression patterns within the subpallium (Dlx5, Nkx2.1, Lhx6, Lhx7/8, Lhx9, Shh, and Gbx1), as well as genes considered markers for specific subpallial neuronal subpopulations. Our results indicate that most of the centromedial and extended amygdala is formed by cells derived from multiple subpallial subdivisions. Contrary to a previous suggestion, only the central--but not the medial--amygdala derives from the lateral ganglionic eminence and has striatal-like features. The medial amygdala and a large part of the extended amygdala (including the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis) consist of subdivisions or cell groups that derive from subpallial, pallial (ventral pallium), or extratelencephalic progenitor domains. The subpallial part includes derivatives from the medial ganglionic eminence, the anterior peduncular area, and possibly a novel subdivision, called here commissural preoptic area, located at the base of the septum and related to the anterior commissure. Our study provides a molecular and morphological foundation for understanding the complex embryonic origins and adult organization of the centromedial and extended amygdala.
17990317	Novel mutant-enriched sequencing identified high frequency of PIK3CA mutations in pharyngeal cancer.	We previously reported 4 PIK3CA mutations in 38 head and neck cancer samples, 3 of which were identified in 6 pharyngeal cancer samples. To determine the mutation frequency of PIK3CA in pharyngeal cancer, we studied 24 additional cases of pharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma in this study. Using both direct genomic DNA sequencing and novel mutant-enriched sequencing methods developed specifically for the 3 hot-spot mutations (H1047R, E545K and E452K) of PIK3CA, we detected 5 mutations of PIK3CA in the 24 pharyngeal cancers (20.8%). Three of the 5 mutations had been missed by the conventional sequencing method and were subsequently detected by novel mutant-enriched sequencing methods. We showed that the mutant-enriched sequencing method for the H1047R hot-spot mutation can identify the mutation in a mixed population of mutant and wild-type DNA sequences at 1:360 ratios. These novel mutant-enriched sequencing methods allow the detection of the PIK3CA hot-spot mutations in clinical specimens which often contain limited tumor tissues (i.e., biopsy specimens). The data further support that oncogenic PIK3CA may play a critical role in pharyngeal carcinogenesis, and the mutant-enriched sequencing methods for PIK3CA are sensitive and reliable ways to detect PIK3CA mutations in clinical samples. Because PIK3CA and its pathway are potential targets for chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and frequent somatic mutation of PIK3CA has been identified in many human cancer types (e.g., breast cancer, colorectal cancer), the abilities to detect PIK3CA mutations with enhanced sensitivities have great potential impacts on target therapies for many cancer types.
17990328	Amplification of PRKCI, located in 3q26, is associated with lymph node metastasis in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.	DNA amplification is one of the mechanisms to activate genes that are implicated in neoplastic transformation and gain of chromosome band 3q26 is a common event in squamous cell carcinomas. The aim of the present work was to identify the specific target gene from four candidates (MDS1, PRKCI, ECT2, and PIK3CA) located on 3q26 amplification in esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCCs). To assess the prevalence of copy number gains of putative genes, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was applied on 108 ESCCs and 9 ESCC cell lines. Our data showed that MDS1 and PRKCI were more frequently gained. Positive correlation was found only for PRKCI between amplification and tumor size (P = 0.043), lymph node metastasis (P = 0.015) and clinical stage (P = 0.002). PRKCI gene amplification was highly correlated with protein overexpression (P = 0.009), suggesting that gene amplification is one important mechanism involved in PRKCI overexpression. To investigate further the role of PRKCI alteration in esophageal tumors, a tissue microarray containing samples from 180 ESCCs was used for immunohistochemistry analysis. Statistical analysis revealed that PRKCI overexpression was correlated with lymph node metastasis (P = 0.002) and higher stage (P = 0.004). Performing multivariate logistic regression analysis, a significant association between PRKCI overexpression and presence of lymph node metastasis was found, which was independent of T-stage of the primary tumors (P = 0.004). Our results indicate that PRKCI is an attractive target in the 3q26 amplicon and that it may serve as a molecular marker for metastasis and occult advanced tumor stages in ESCC.
17991497	Xanthones with quinone reductase-inducing activity from the fruits of Garcinia mangostana (Mangosteen).	Bioactivity-guided fractionation of a dichloromethane-soluble extract of Garcinia mangostana fruits has led to the isolation and identification of five compounds, including two xanthones, 1,2-dihydro-1,8,10-trihydroxy-2-(2-hydroxypropan-2-yl)-9-(3-methylbut-2-enyl)furo[3,2-a]xanthen-11-one (1) and 6-deoxy-7-demethylmangostanin (2), along with three known compounds, 1,3,7-trihydroxy-2,8-di-(3-methylbut-2-enyl)xanthone (3), mangostanin (4), and alpha-mangostin (5). The structures of compounds 1 and 2 were determined from analysis of their spectroscopic data. All isolated compounds in the present study together with eleven other compounds previously isolated from the pericarp of mangosteen, were tested in an in vitro quinone reductase-induction assay using murine hepatoma cells (Hepa 1c1c7) and an in vitro hydroxyl radical antioxidant assay. Of these, compounds 1-4 induced quinone reductase (concentration to double enzyme induction, 0.68-2.2microg/mL) in Hepa 1c1c7 cells and gamma-mangostin (6) exhibited hydroxyl radical-scavenging activity (IC50, 0.20microg/mL).
17991680	The Zebrafish Information Network: the zebrafish model organism database provides expanded support for genotypes and phenotypes.	The Zebrafish Information Network (ZFIN, http://zfin.org), the model organism database for zebrafish, provides the central location for curated zebrafish genetic, genomic and developmental data. Extensive data integration of mutant phenotypes, genes, expression patterns, sequences, genetic markers, morpholinos, map positions, publications and community resources facilitates the use of the zebrafish as a model for studying gene function, development, behavior and disease. Access to ZFIN data is provided via web-based query forms and through bulk data files. ZFIN is the definitive source for zebrafish gene and allele nomenclature, the zebrafish anatomical ontology (AO) and for zebrafish gene ontology (GO) annotations. ZFIN plays an active role in the development of cross-species ontologies such as the phenotypic quality ontology (PATO) and the gene ontology (GO). Recent enhancements to ZFIN include (i) a new home page and navigation bar, (ii) expanded support for genotypes and phenotypes, (iii) comprehensive phenotype annotations based on anatomical, phenotypic quality and gene ontologies, (iv) a BLAST server tightly integrated with the ZFIN database via ZFIN-specific datasets, (v) a global site search and (vi) help with hands-on resources.
17991749	Evidence for the "dock, lock, and latch" ligand binding mechanism of the staphylococcal microbial surface component recognizing adhesive matrix molecules (MSCRAMM) SdrG.	Staphylococcus epidermidis is an opportunistic pathogen and a major cause of foreign body infections. The S. epidermidis fibrinogen (Fg)-binding adhesin SdrG is necessary and sufficient for the attachment of this pathogen to Fg-coated materials. Based largely on structural analyses of the ligand binding domain of SdrG as an apo-protein and in complex with a Fg-like peptide, we proposed that SdrG follows a "dock, lock, and latch" mechanism to bind to Fg. This binding mechanism involves the docking of the ligand in a pocket formed between two SdrG subdomains followed by the movement of a C-terminal extension of one subdomain to cover the ligand and to insert and complement a beta-sheet in a neighboring subdomain. These proposed events result in a greatly stabilized closed conformation of the MSCRAMM-ligand complex. In this report, we describe a biochemical analysis of the proposed conformational changes that SdrG undergoes upon binding to its ligand. We have introduced disulfide bonds into SdrG to stabilize the open and closed forms of the apo-form of the MSCRAMM. We show that the stabilized closed form does not bind to the ligand and that binding can be restored in the presence of reducing agents such as dithiothreitol. We have also used Förster resonance energy transfer to dynamically show the conformational changes of SdrG upon binding to its ligand. Finally, we have used isothermic calorimetry to determine that hydrophobic interactions between the ligand and the protein are responsible for re-directing the C-terminal extension of the second subdomain required for triggering the beta-strand complementation event.
17991895	DNA methylation inhibitor 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine induces reversible genome-wide DNA damage that is distinctly influenced by DNA methyltransferases 1 and 3B.	Genome-wide DNA methylation patterns are frequently deregulated in cancer. There is considerable interest in targeting the methylation machinery in tumor cells using nucleoside analogs of cytosine, such as 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-azadC). 5-azadC exerts its antitumor effects by reactivation of aberrantly hypermethylated growth regulatory genes and cytoxicity resulting from DNA damage. We sought to better characterize the DNA damage response of tumor cells to 5-azadC and the role of DNA methyltransferases 1 and 3B (DNMT1 and DNMT3B, respectively) in modulating this process. We demonstrate that 5-azadC treatment results in growth inhibition and G(2) arrest-hallmarks of a DNA damage response. 5-azadC treatment led to formation of DNA double-strand breaks, as monitored by formation of gamma-H2AX foci and comet assay, in an ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated)-dependent manner, and this damage was repaired following drug removal. Further analysis revealed activation of key strand break repair proteins including ATM, ATR (ATM-Rad3-related), checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1), BRCA1, NBS1, and RAD51 by Western blotting and immunofluorescence. Significantly, DNMT1-deficient cells demonstrated profound defects in these responses, including complete lack of gamma-H2AX induction and blunted p53 and CHK1 activation, while DNMT3B-deficient cells generally showed mild defects. We identified a novel interaction between DNMT1 and checkpoint kinase CHK1 and showed that the defective damage response in DNMT1-deficient cells is at least in part due to altered CHK1 subcellular localization. This study therefore greatly enhances our understanding of the mechanisms underlying 5-azadC cytotoxicity and reveals novel functions for DNMT1 as a component of the cellular response to DNA damage, which may help optimize patient responses to this agent in the future.
17992503	Characterizing HMW-GS alleles of decaploid Agropyron elongatum in relation to evolution and wheat breeding.	Bread wheat quality is mainly correlated with high molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) of endosperm. The number of HMW-GS alleles with good processing quality is limited in bread wheat cultivars, while there are plenty of HMW-GS alleles in wheat-related grasses to exploit. We report here on the cloning and characterization of HMW-GS alleles from the decaploid Agropyron elongatum. Eleven novel HMW-GS alleles were cloned from the grass. Of them, five are x-type and six y-type glutenin subunit genes. Three alleles Aex4, Aey7, and Aey9 showed high similarity with another three alleles from the diploid Lophopyrum elongatum, which provided direct evidence for the Ee genome origination of A. elongatum. It was noted that C-terminal regions of three alleles of the y-type genes Aey8, Aey9, and Aey10 showed more similarity with x-type genes than with other y-type genes. This demonstrates that there is a kind of intermediate state that appeared in the divergence between x- and y-type genes in the HMW-GS evolution. One x-type subunit, Aex4, with an additional cysteine residue, was speculated to be correlated with the good processing quality of wheat introgression lines. Aey4 was deduced to be a chimeric gene from the recombination between another two genes. How the HMW-GS genes of A. elongatum may contribute to the improvement of wheat processing quality are discussed.
17992525	Copper resistance of biofilm cells of the plant pathogen Xylella fastidiosa.	Xylella fastidiosa is a phytopathogen that causes diseases in different plant species. The development of disease symptoms is associated to the blockage of the xylem vessels caused by biofilm formation. In this study, we evaluated the sensitivity of biofilm and planktonic cells to copper, one of the most important antimicrobial agents used in agriculture. We measured the exopolysaccharides (EPS) content in biofilm and planktonic cells and used real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction to evaluate the expression of the genes encoding proteins involved in cation/multidrug extrusion (acrA/B, mexE/czcA, and metI) and others associated with different copper resistance mechanisms (copB, cutA1, cutA2, and cutC) in the X. fastidiosa biofilm formed in two different media. We confirmed that biofilms are less susceptible to copper than planktonic cells. The amount of EPS seems to be directly related to the resistance and it varies according to the media where the cells are grown. The same was observed for gene expression. Nevertheless, some genes seem to have a greater importance in biofilm cells resistance to copper. Our results suggest a synergistic effect between diffusion barriers and other mechanisms associated with bacterial resistance in this phytopathogen. These mechanisms are important for a bacterium that is constantly under stress conditions in the host.
17992701	Psychiatric morbidity and its screening in Turkish women with breast cancer: a comparison between the HADS and SCID tests.	OBJECTIVE: Adjustment disorders (ADs) and major depressive disorder (MDD) are often the most prevalent psychiatric disorders among cancer patients. This study's objective was to determine the overall performance of Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) as a screening instrument in identifying cases of psychiatric morbidity such as ADs and MDD. METHODS: Two hundred and four consecutive patients completed a questionnaire including a demographic and clinical data form, HADS, and were examined with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID). The screening performance of HADS was investigated by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristics curves (AUC), rates of specificity, and sensitivity. RESULTS: For MDD; the AUC was 0.77 on the HADS total, the AUC was 0.79 on the HADS depression subscale, and was 0.72 on the anxiety subscale. For ADs; the results were 0.74, 0.74, and 0.70 respectively. Findings indicated that a HADS total cut-off score of > or =17 to be optimal in identifying cases of MDD. This cut-off score offered a sensitivity of 0.70 and a specificity of 0.80. Findings suggested that a HADS total cut-off score of 10 was the optimal combination of sensitivity (0.84) and specificity (0.55) for ADs. When compared with SCID, the percentage of cases identified by HADS was 28% for MDD and 22% for ADs. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with SCID, HADS was found to have acceptable levels of sensitivity and specificity in detecting psychiatric morbidity especially for MDD and HADS can be recommended with reservations as a screening tool for breast cancer patients.
17993517	Influence of quorum sensing and iron on twitching motility and biofilm formation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.	Reducing iron (Fe) levels in a defined minimal medium reduced the growth yields of planktonic and biofilm Pseudomonas aeruginosa, though biofilm biomass was affected to the greatest extent and at FeCl3 concentrations where planktonic cell growth was not compromised. Highlighting this apparently greater need for Fe, biofilm growth yields were markedly reduced in a mutant unable to produce pyoverdine (and, so, deficient in pyoverdine-mediated Fe acquisition) at concentrations of FeCl3 that did not adversely affect biofilm yields of a pyoverdine-producing wild-type strain. Concomitant with the reduced biofilm yields at low Fe concentrations, P. aeruginosa showed enhanced twitching motility in Fe-deficient versus Fe-replete minimal media. A mutant deficient in low-Fe-stimulated twitching motility but normal as regards twitching motility on Fe-rich medium was isolated and shown to be disrupted in rhlI, whose product is responsible for synthesis of the N-butanoyl homoserine lactone (C4-HSL) quorum-sensing signal. In contrast to wild-type cells, which formed thin, flat, undeveloped biofilms in Fe-limited medium, the rhlI mutant formed substantially developed though not fully mature biofilms under Fe limitation. C4-HSL production increased markedly in Fe-limited versus Fe-rich P. aeruginosa cultures, and cell-free low-Fe culture supernatants restored the twitching motility of the rhlI mutant on Fe-limited minimal medium and stimulated the twitching motility of rhlI and wild-type P. aeruginosa on Fe-rich minimal medium. Still, addition of exogenous C4-HSL did not stimulate the twitching motility of either strain on Fe-replete medium, indicating that some Fe-regulated and RhlI/C4-HSL-dependent extracellular product(s) was responsible for the enhanced twitching motility (and reduced biofilm formation) seen in response to Fe limitation.
17994114	Gastrointestinal roles for proteinase-activated receptors in health and disease.	It has been almost a decade since the molecular cloning of all four members of the proteinase-activated receptor (PAR) family was completed. This unique family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) mediates specific cellular actions of various endogenous proteinases including thrombin, trypsin, tryptase, etc. and also certain exogenous enzymes. Increasing evidence has been clarifying the emerging roles played by PARs in health and disease. PARs, particularly PAR1 and PAR2, are distributed throughout the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, modulating various GI functions. One of the most important GI functions of PARs is regulation of exocrine secretion in the salivary glands, pancreas and GI mucosal epithelium. PARs also modulate motility of GI smooth muscle, involving multiple mechanisms. PAR2 appears to play dual roles in pancreatitis and related pain, being pro-inflammatory/pro-nociceptive and anti-inflammatory/anti-nociceptive. Similarly, dual roles for PAR1 and PAR2 have been demonstrated in mucosal inflammation/damage throughout the GI tract. There is also fundamental and clinical evidence for involvement of PAR2 in colonic pain. PARs are thus considered key molecules in regulation of GI functions and targets for development of drugs for treatment of various GI diseases.
17994221	Comparison of the confusion assessment method for the intensive care unit (CAM-ICU) with the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) for delirium in critical care patients gives high agreement rate(s).	OBJECTIVE: In the intensive care unit (ICU) we assessed the agreement between the delirium ratings of two independent delirium assessment methods: (a) the Confusion Assessment method for the ICU (CAM-ICU); and (b) the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC). DESIGN: Prospective, descriptive cohort study. SETTING AND PATIENTS: During a 6-month period, 174 patients (mean age 62.4+/-13.0 years) admitted to the ICU after elective surgery or after an emergency were included and assessed with both delirium assessment systems by two trained independent investigators (research person and bedside nurses) during their ICU stay or for up to 7 days after ICU admission. INTERVENTIONS: Patients' clinical characteristics at ICU admission day were documented. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: After excluding permanently unconscious patients with <or=-4 on the Richmond Agitation Sedations scale, delirium was identified in 71 of the 174 patients (41%). The patients who were included were tested in 374 paired but researcher-independent ratings of delirium by both scoring methods. The kappa coefficient determined over 7 days of ICU stay was 0.80 (CI 95%: 0.78-0.84; p<0.001), indicating good agreement. CONCLUSION: It is concluded from the present investigation that the two scoring methods represent good diagnostic tools with high agreement rates in critical ill ICU patients.
17995450	G protein-coupled receptor sorting to endosomes and lysosomes.	The heptahelical G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) belong to the largest family of cell surface signaling receptors encoded in the human genome. GPCRs signal to diverse extracellular stimuli and control a vast number of physiological responses, making this receptor class the target of nearly half the drugs currently in use. In addition to rapid desensitization, receptor trafficking is crucial for the temporal and spatial control of GPCR signaling. Sorting signals present in the intracytosolic domains of GPCRs regulate trafficking through the endosomal-lysosomal system. GPCR internalization is mediated by serine and threonine phosphorylation and arrestin binding. Short, linear peptide sequences including tyrosine- and dileucine-based motifs, and PDZ ligands that are recognized by distinct endocytic adaptor proteins also mediate internalization and endosomal sorting of GPCRs. We present new data from bioinformatic searches that reveal the presence of these types of sorting signals in the cytoplasmic tails of many known GPCRs. Several recent studies also indicate that the covalent modification of GPCRs with ubiquitin serves as a signal for internalization and lysosomal sorting, expanding the diversity of mechanisms that control trafficking of mammalian GPCRs.
17995960	Evaluating Burkholderia pseudomallei Bip proteins as vaccines and Bip antibodies as detection agents.	Burkholderia pseudomallei is a biothreat agent and an important natural pathogen, causing melioidosis in humans and animals. A type III secretion system (TTSS-3) has been shown to be critical for virulence. Because TTSS components from other pathogens have been used successfully as diagnostic agents and as experimental vaccines, it was investigated whether this was the case for BipB, BipC and BipD, components of B. pseudomallei's TTSS-3. The sequences of BipB, BipC and BipD were found to be highly conserved among B. pseudomallei and B. mallei isolates. A collection of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for each Bip protein was obtained. Most recognized both native and denatured Bip protein. Burkholderia pseudomallei or B. mallei did not express detectable BipB or BipD under the growth conditions used. However, anti-BipD mAbs did recognize the TTSS needle structures of a Shigella strain engineered to express BipD. The authors did not find that BipB, BipC or BipD are protective antigens because vaccination of mice with any single protein did not result in protection against experimental melioidosis. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) studies showed that human melioidosis patients had antibodies to BipB and BipD. However, these ELISAs had low diagnostic accuracy in endemic regions, possibly due to previous patient exposure to B. pseudomallei.
17996018	The pyruvate, orthophosphate dikinase regulatory proteins of Arabidopsis possess a novel, unprecedented Ser/Thr protein kinase primary structure.	Pyruvate, orthophosphate dikinase (PPDK) is a ubiquitous, low-abundance metabolic enzyme of undetermined function in C3 plants. Its activity in C3 chloroplasts is light-regulated via reversible phosphorylation of an active-site Thr residue by the PPDK regulatory protein (RP), a most unusual bifunctional protein kinase (PK)/protein phosphatase (PP). In this paper we document the molecular cloning and functional analysis of the two unique C3 RPs in Arabidopsis thaliana. The first of these, AtRP1, encodes a typical chloroplast-targeted, bifunctional C4-like RP. The second RP gene, AtRP2, encodes a monofunctional polypeptide that possesses in vitro RP-like PK activity but lacks PP activity, and is localized in the cytosol. Notably, the deduced primary structures of these two highly homologous polypeptides are devoid of any canonical subdomain structure that unifies all known eukaryotic and prokaryotic Ser/Thr PKs into one of three superfamilies, despite the direct demonstration that AtRP1 is functionally a member of this group. Instead, these C3 RPs and the related C4 plant homologues encode a conserved, centrally positioned, approximately 260-residue sequence currently described as the 'domain of unknown function 299' (DUF 299). We propose that vascular plant RPs form a unique protein kinase family now designated as the DUF 299 gene family.
17996375	Kank proteins: a new family of ankyrin-repeat domain-containing proteins.	The human Kank gene was found as a candidate tumor suppressor for renal cell carcinoma, and encodes an ankyrin-repeat domain-containing protein, Kank. Here, we report a new family of proteins consisting of three Kank (Kank1)-associated members, Kank2, Kank3 and Kank4, which were found by domain and phylogenetic analyses. Besides the conserved ankyrin-repeat and coiled-coil domains, there was a conserved motif at the N-terminal (KN motif) containing potential motifs for nuclear localization and export signals. Gene expression of these genes was examined by RT-PCR at the mRNA level and by Western blotting and immunostaining at the protein level. Kank family genes showed variations in the expression level among tissues and kidney cell lines. Furthermore, the results of overexpression of these genes in NIH3T3 cells suggest that all of these family proteins have an identical role in the formation of actin stress fibers.
17996384	Time trends in nodal volumes and motion during radiotherapy for patients with stage III non-small-cell lung cancer.	PURPOSE: Knowledge of changes in gross tumor volume (GTV) and of GTV motion during a course of radiotherapy is necessary for accurate treatment delivery. This study describes the time trends in nodal computed tomography (CT) volume and motion for patients with locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a prospective clinical trial, 12 patients with a total of 22 positive nodes underwent a CT-positron emission tomography scan before treatment, as well as in the first and second week following start of radiotherapy. Volume changes could be measured for all nodes. For 21 nodes, the motion was measured on the basis of a respiration correlated CT (RCCT) scan. Repeated RCCT scans were available for 11 nodes to evaluate the change in motion. RESULTS: In 6 of 22 (27%) patients, the nodal volume increased >30%, whereas in 3 of 22 (14%) the volume decreased >30%. On average, the nodal volume did not change significantly (from 4.9 to 5.1 to 4.6 cm(3)). The average motion of the nodal areas was initially 5.6 +/- 2.8 mm. This motion decreased slightly during therapy but not statistically significant. However, large interpatient and internodal motion differences were observed. CONCLUSION: A large variability of changes in nodal volume between patients was observed. However, this had limited clinical impact because volumes and hence volume changes were small. The nodal motion did not change significantly during therapy. However, because of the large interpatient variability of nodal motion before treatment, internal margins for nodal areas should be calculated before radiotherapy using RCCT, such that the margins can be applied for individual patients. Repeated imaging of the nodes seems however to be of limited use because the observed individual changes in nodal volume and motion tend to fall within the commonly applied margins.
17996389	Time dependence of intrafraction patient motion assessed by repeat stereoscopic imaging.	PURPOSE: To quantify intrafraction patient motion and its time dependence in immobilized intracranial and extracranial patients. The data can be used to optimize the intrafraction imaging frequency and consequent patient setup correction with an image guidance and tracking system, and to establish the required safety margins in the absence of such a system. METHOD AND MATERIALS: The intrafraction motion of 32 intracranial patients, immobilized with a thermoplastic mask, and 11 supine- and 14 prone-treated extracranial spine patients, immobilized with a vacuum bag, were analyzed. The motion was recorded by an X-ray, stereoscopic, image-guidance system. For each group, we calculated separately the systematic (overall mean and SD) and the random displacement as a function of elapsed intrafraction time. RESULTS: The SD of the systematic intrafraction displacements increased linearly over time for all three patient groups. For intracranial-, supine-, and prone-treated patients, the SD increased to 0.8, 1.2, and 2.2 mm, respectively, in a period of 15 min. The random displacements for the prone-treated patients were significantly higher than for the other groups, namely 1.6 mm (1 SD), probably caused by respiratory motion. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the applied immobilization devices, patients drift away from their initial position during a treatment fraction. These drifts are in general small if compared with conventional treatment margins, but will significantly contribute to the margin for high-precision radiation treatments with treatment times of 15 min or longer.
17996461	Forebrain oscillators ticking with different clock hands.	Clock proteins like PER1 and PER2 are expressed in the brain, but little is known about their functionality outside the main suprachiasmatic clock. Here we show that PER1 and PER2 were neither uniformly present nor identically phased in forebrain structures of mice fed ad libitum. Altered expression of the clock gene Cry1 was observed in respective Per1 or Per2 mutants. In response to hypocaloric feeding, PERs timing was not markedly affected in few forebrain structures (hippocampus). In most other forebrain oscillators, including those expressing only PER1 (e.g., dorsomedial hypothalamus), PER2 (e.g., paraventricular hypothalamus) or both (e.g., paraventricular thalamus), PER1 was up-regulated and PER2 largely phase-advanced. Cry1 expression was selectively modified in the forebrain of Per mutants challenged with hypocaloric feeding. Our results suggest that there is not one single cerebral clock, but a system of multiple brain oscillators ticking with different clock hands and differentially sensitive to nutritional cues.
17996483	Regulation of HGF and SDF-1 expression by oral fibroblasts--implications for invasion of oral cancer.	Invasion and metastasis of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is dependent on signals received from stromal fibroblasts present in the surrounding connective tissue. The aim of this study was to investigate the regulation of expression of two important signaling molecules--HGF and SDF-1--by both stromal fibroblasts and their 'activated' form, myofibroblasts, and to determine the role of these two factors in stimulating OSCC cell invasion in vitro. Fibroblasts and myofibroblasts produced similar levels of HGF and SDF-1. IL-1alpha and OSCC cell conditioned medium both stimulated HGF and SDF-1 expression, while TGF-beta(1) inhibited production of each factor. Myofibroblast-derived conditioned medium stimulated OSCC cell invasion through matrigel. Blocking antibodies to both HGF and SDF-1 reduced the level of invasion. In fibroblast-free organotypic raft cultures, addition of HGF and SDF-1 stimulated OSCC cell invasion into the underlying collagen gel, although the pattern of invasion differed from that induced by fibroblasts. Fibroblast-derived HGF and SDF-1 appear to play central roles in the reciprocal interactions between OSCC cells and underlying stromal fibroblasts leading to the local invasion of oral cancer.
17996496	A novel application of high-dose (50kGy) gamma irradiation for demineralized bone matrix: effects on fusion rate in a rat spinal fusion model.	BACKGROUND CONTEXT: The safety of allograft material has come under scrutiny because of recent reports of allograft-associated bacterial and viral infections in tissue recipients. Gamma irradiation, although being one of the most effective ways of terminal sterilization, has been shown to affect the biomechanical properties of allograft bone. It may also have detrimental effects on the osteoinductivity of allograft material such as demineralized bone matrix (DBM) by the denaturation of proteins because of heat generated by irradiation. Sterilization of DBM material is an important variable in processing graft materials. This is considered to be one of the factors leading to different fusion rates observed with different commercially available DBM products, as the sterilization procedure itself may affect the osteoinductivity of the material. Currently, there is no ideal sterilization technique that limits the detrimental effect on osteoinductivity and fusion rates. PURPOSE: To evaluate the effects of a range of hydrogen peroxide exposures with or without the controlled high-dose gamma irradiation after processing with radioprotectant solutions (Clearant radiation sterilization procedure) on the fusion rates of human DBM. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective in vivo animal study. METHODS: Eighty mature athymic nude female rats were used for this study, which formed 10 equal groups. Human DBM exposed to hydrogen peroxide for different time periods (0, 1, 6, and 24 hours) was divided into two major subgroups. One group was further treated with controlled high-dose radiation using radioprotectants (radiation treated), whereas the other group was frozen immediately without specific treatment (non-radiation treated). Both radiation-treated and non-radiation-treated DBM material from each group of hydrogen peroxide exposure times were implanted between L4 and L5 transverse processes of the rats forming eight test groups including eight animals in each. The remaining 16 rats were divided into two additional groups to form negative (only decortication, n=8) and positive (bone morphogenetic protein [BMP]-2, n=8) control groups. The rats were evaluated for fusion by radiographs (2, 4, and 8 weeks), manual palpation (8 weeks), and histological analysis after sacrificing. Comparison of fusion rate among all groups was made using these three evaluation methods. RESULTS: Increasing the time period of hydrogen peroxide (0, 1, 6, or 24 hours) exposure for preparation of DBM from bone allograft did not affect the fusion rates significantly (p<.05), although there was a trend toward decreasing fusion rates with longer exposure times. When the hydrogen peroxide washed DBM preparations were also radiation treated, the resulting fusion rates were again not significantly different (p<.05). Agreement among fusion detection methods was found to be high. CONCLUSIONS: Hydrogen peroxide processing was not detrimental to fusion rates. The additional terminal sterilization technique with special gamma irradiation protocols (Clearant process) also did not decrease the fusion rates but could provide an additional margin of safety.
17996949	Porcine interferon-gamma protects swine from foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV).	Porcine interferon-gamma (PoIFN-gamma) fused with glutathione S-transferase (GST) was expressed in Escherichia coli BL(21). Twenty 6-week-old piglets were randomly assigned to four groups. Pigs in groups 1-3 were pretreated with 30 mg, 20 mg, and 10 mg recombinant PoIFN-gamma (rPoIFN-gamma), respectively. Pigs in group 4 (control) were pretreated with GST expressed by the empty plasmid. At 48h postinoculation (hpi), all swine were challenged with FMDV (serotype O). Pigs pretreated with 30 mg rPoIFN-gamma were completely protected from virulent FMDV attack. Pigs given 20 mg rPoIFN-gamma achieved partial protection, and the unprotected piglets showed clinical signs from 68h postchallenge (hpc). Although 10 mg rPoIFN-gamma did not confer protection against FMDV, the pigs pretreated with this dose of rPoIFN-gamma presented clinical signs from 35 hpc, which was later than the control group (14 hpc). These results indicate that PoIFN-gamma can protect swine against attack from FMDV or delay the appearance of clinical signs; the effect is dose dependent.
17997047	Beyond the "Binge" threshold: heavy drinking patterns and their association with alcohol involvement indices in college students.	Despite its ubiquity, the term "Binge" drinking has been controversial. Among other things, the grouping of drinkers into a single risk category based on a relatively low threshold may not capture adequately the nature of problem drinking behaviors. The present study is an initial examination of the utility of delineating heavy drinkers into three groups; those who typically drink below the traditional "Binge" cutoff (less than 4+/5+ drinks per occasion for women/men), those who met traditional "Binge" drinking criteria, and a higher "Binge" cutoff of 6+/7+ (women, men). We examined differences in drunkenness, drinking frequency, and unique types of alcohol problems. Participants (N=356; 184 women) were regularly drinking college students at a mid-sized U.S. university who completed a battery of self-report measures including a calendar of daily alcohol consumption, and the 8-domain Young Adult Alcohol Consequences Questionnaire (YAACQ). Estimated Blood Alcohol Levels (eBALs) were calculated. We found that the standard 4+/5+ drink "Binge" cutoff distinguishes drinkers across some but not all indices of alcohol involvement. "Binge" drinkers differed from their "Non-Binge" counterparts on eBAL, but for other indicators (drinking frequency, total alcohol consequences), only "Heavy Binge" drinkers differed significantly from "Non-Binge" drinkers. Importantly, "Heavy Binge" drinkers experienced higher levels of those specific consequences associated with more problematic alcohol involvement. Findings suggest that not all "Binge" drinkers drink alike, are equally drunk, or experience similar consequences. As such, there may be utility in distinguishing among heavy drinkers, in order to focus appropriately on those at greatest risk for different types of consequences.
17997057	Seasonal changes of sperm storage and correlative structures in male and female soft-shelled turtles, Trionyx sinensis.	Reproductive ducts of male and female soft-shelled turtles, Trionyx sinensis were examined throughout the year (March, May, September, December) using brightfield and electron microscopes (TEM and SEM), to determine the location and histomorphological characteristics of sperm storage structures as well as their changes at different phases of the seasonal reproductive cycle. Sperm stored in the epididymis were also examined. In the male, spermatogenesis is initiated in spring (May), and then the mature sperm are released in autumn as an episodic event. Spermatogenesis is inactive in winter. However, in this species, the epididymis contains sperm throughout the entire year. Sperm observed in the epididymis are intact and some structures are uniquely different from other reptiles, and is characterized by 35-40 concentric mitochondria with a dense core in the centre. Many glycogen granules are observed in the cytoplasm of the midpiece. However, the epithelial cell type of epididymal duct change in different seasons. The cells are fully developed with a highly secretory activity in September. The materials secreted from the epithelium might have the function as nourishment for the stored sperm. Sperm storage structures in the form of tubules are observed in the wall of the isthmus of the oviduct in hibernating females but are absent in the groups of May and September. These tubules develop either by folding or fusion of the oviductal mucosal folds and are lined by both ciliated and secretory cells. These tubules might provide a microenvironment for the sperm to enable its long-term storage. After being separated 4 months (December-March) from the male, sperm are observed in the tubules of the isthmus of the oviduct. The unique character of the sperm combined with the special sperm storage structures enable the sperm to maintain fertility and activity during their storage.
17997087	Clinical significance of Mycobacterium fortuitum isolated from respiratory specimens.	BACKGROUND: Although Mycobacterium fortuitum is not an uncommon organism among the non-tuberculous mycobacteria isolated from respiratory specimens, its clinical significance had not been well studied. METHODS: We identified all patients whose respiratory specimens were positive for M. fortuitum between January 2003 and December 2005. Among 182 patients whose specimens were positive for M. fortuitum, 26 were positive at least twice. We retrospectively reviewed their characteristics, and clinical courses. RESULTS: Of the 26 patients, 15 had two positive culture results for M. fortuitum; the other 11 had three or more. Sixteen patients were male and the median age was 61.5 years. Major presenting symptoms were cough (65%) and sputum (58%). Most patients had known underlying lung diseases, including prior tuberculosis (54%), lung cancer (15%), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (15%), and other mycobacterial lung disease (15%). The most common CT findings were bronchiectasis (80%). Only one patient received specific prolonged antibiotic therapy against M. fortuitum infection; the other 25 did not. No patients showed clinical aggravation during the follow-up period, although in five patients their underlying lung diseases continued to progress. The median follow-up duration was 12.5 months and none of the patients whose sputum specimens were available had persistent positive cultures for M. fortuitum. CONCLUSION: M. fortuitum usually causes colonization or transient infection in patients with underlying lung disease, such as prior tuberculosis or bronchiectasis. The majority of patients may not need to receive prolonged antibiotic therapy for M. fortuitum isolates.
17997112	Amygdala tractography predicts functional connectivity and learning during feedback-guided decision-making.	Flexibly adapting behavior in dynamic environments relies on fronto-limbic networks that include the amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, and striatum. Animal work demonstrates that interactions among these regions are critical for flexible feedback-guided learning, but it remains unknown to what extent such anatomical-functional interactions operate in humans. Here, we use connectivity analyses in both structural and functional MRI to further our understanding of how brain circuits work in conjunction to promote goal-directed behavior. In particular, fiber tracking based on diffusion-weighted imaging provides information about anatomical connectivity between brain structures, and functional MRI provides estimates of functional connectivity between structures. We found that, during a feedback-guided reversal learning task, the strength of estimated white matter tracts from the amygdala to the hippocampus, orbitofrontal cortex, and ventral striatum predicted both how subjects adapted their behavior following positive and negative feedback, and the functional connectivity (estimated from functional MRI time series) between the amygdala and these regions. In addition, we identified a dissociation between an amygdala-hippocampus circuit that predicted response switching, and an amygdala-orbitofrontal cortex circuit that predicted learning following rule reversals. These findings provide novel insights into how the anatomy and functioning of amygdala-related brain circuits mediate different aspects of feedback-guided learning behavior.
17997147	High frequency of BRCA1/2 germline mutations in consecutive ovarian cancer patients in Poland.	BACKGROUND: We estimated the prevalence of BRCA1/2 germline mutations in consecutive ovarian cancers and correlated the mutation status with clinicopathological features. METHODS: 151 consecutive primary ovarian cancer patients were screened for BRCA1/2 germline mutations. RESULTS: We identified BRCA1/2 germline mutations in 21 (13.9%) patients. Seventeen (81%) of carriers have BRCA1 and four (19%) have BRCA2 mutation. BRCA1/2 carriers have a distinctly longer overall survival than sporadic cases (log-rank, p=0.014). CONCLUSIONS: The relatively high proportion of BRCA1/2 carriers among unselected ovarian cancer patients indicates the necessity of searching for recurrent BRCA mutations in each case of ovarian carcinoma. This routine screen should be widened to include denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) analysis of both exons 11 of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in women with positive family history.
17997202	Influence of clinical placement on undergraduate midwifery students' career intentions.	OBJECTIVE: to explore the influence that clinical placements have on career intentions for undergraduate midwifery students. DESIGN: a qualitative approach involving a combination of focus group and individual interviews. SETTING: the study was part of a larger study undertaken across a range of health disciplines within one university. PARTICIPANTS: 11 Bachelor of Midwifery students who had either undertaken their first or last clinical placement. FINDINGS: data were managed with QSR NVivo and analysis was influenced by the work of Strauss and Corbin. Two main themes emerged: midwifery as a career choice and future midwifery career. Findings indicated that students entered the course with preconceived ideas of midwifery and where they would practice after graduation. Clinical placements allowed students to experience the reality of midwifery practice, promote identification with the profession, and influenced decision-making about future careers. Finally, it raised limitations placed on diversity of available clinical experience. KEY CONCLUSIONS: clinical placements are essential for midwifery preparation. They challenge students' preconceived ideas about midwifery practice and assist them to develop perspectives on, and directions for, their future careers. The diversity and quality of placement experience plays a significant role in career decision-making and employment choices. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: positive placement experiences influence where students will choose to work after graduation. These experiences can directly influence the organisations and clinical areas chosen by students for graduate practice.
17997344	Manual physical assessment of spinal segmental motion: intent and validity.	Validity of a clinical test can be defined as the extent to which the test actually assesses what it is intended to assess. In order to investigate the validity of manual physical assessment of the spine, it is therefore essential to establish what physical therapists intend to assess when they are applying these tests. The aims of this study were to (1) establish what manual physical therapists are intending to assess while applying passive intervertebral motion tests; and (2) examine the face validity and content validity for manual physical assessment of the spine. We surveyed 1502 members of the national manual physical therapist organisations of New Zealand and the United States of America using a web-based survey instrument. Sixty-six percent of 466 respondents believed passive accessory intervertebral motion (PAIVM) tests were valid for assessing quantity of segmental motion, and 76% believed passive physiologic intervertebral motion (PPIVM) tests were valid for assessing quantity of segmental motion. Ninety-eight percent of manual physical therapists base treatment decisions at least in part on the results of segmental motion tests. Quality of resistance to passive segmental motion was considered of greater importance than quantity of kinematic motion during PAIVM tests, while the quality of complex kinematic motion was considered of greater importance than quantity of displacement kinematics during PPIVM tests. Manual physical therapists accept the face validity of manual physical assessment of spinal segmental motion to a great extent, however a minority voice scepticism. Content validity is dominated by concepts of segmental kinematics and the force-displacement relationship. Intent of assessment does, however, vary widely between therapists. These data will inform the design of concurrent validity studies. Further work is recommended to increase consistency of intent, methodology and terminology in manual physical assessment of the spine.
17997378	Osteocytes as mechanosensors in the inhibition of bone resorption due to mechanical loading.	Bone has the ability to adjust its structure to meet its mechanical environment. The prevailing view of bone mechanobiology is that osteocytes are responsible for detecting and responding to mechanical loading and initiating the bone adaptation process. However, how osteocytes signal effector cells and initiate bone turnover is not well understood. Recent in vitro studies have shown that osteocytes support osteoclast formation and activation when co-cultured with osteoclast precursors. In this study, we examined the osteocytes' role in the mechanical regulation of osteoclast formation and activation. We demonstrated here that (1) mechanical stimulation of MLO-Y4 osteocyte-like cells decreases their osteoclastogenic-support potential when co-cultured with RAW264.7 monocyte osteoclast precursors; (2) soluble factors released by these mechanically stimulated MLO-Y4 cells inhibit osteoclastogenesis induced by ST2 bone marrow stromal cells or MLO-Y4 cells; and (3) soluble RANKL and OPG were released by MLO-Y4 cells, and the expressions of both were found to be mechanically regulated. Our data suggest that mechanical loading decreases the osteocyte's potential to induce osteoclast formation by direct cell-cell contact. However, it is not clear that osteocytes in vivo are able to form contacts with osteoclast precursors. Our data also demonstrate that mechanically stimulated osteocytes release soluble factors that can inhibit osteoclastogenesis induced by other supporting cells including bone marrow stromal cells. In summary, we conclude that osteocytes may function as mechanotransducers by regulating local osteoclastogenesis via soluble signals.
17998173	Distal del(4) (q33) syndrome: detailed clinical presentation and molecular description with array-CGH.	The 4q deletion syndrome, comprising all microscopically visible deletions (interstitial and terminal) is a well-recognized distinctive malformation entity, with an estimated incidence of 1:10,000. Here we present the clinical and molecular findings in a 3-year-old male with a de novo distal deletion of 4q33 [46,XY,del(4) (q33)]. Clinical findings of the patient include: hypertelorism, broad nasal bridge, short nose with anteverted nares, long philtrum, thin upper lip, micro-retrognathia, low-set and protruding ears, pre-auricular tag unilaterally, low posterior hairline, clinodactyly of the 5th fingers, tapering fingers, hypospadias, and severe psychomotor retardation. Soon after birth he developed severe hypotonia and feeding difficulties. Echocardiography at 15 months documented aortic supravalvular membrane resulting in mild aortic stenosis and dysplasia of the pulmonary valve. Genome-wide screening using 1 Mb resolution array-CGH and subsequent FISH analyses defined a 18.9-22.9 Mb deletion located at the beginning of 4q33 and extending to the telomere. The description of additional cases with similar distal deletions of 4q33 will allow a more precise prognosis and is therefore of great value for genetic counsellors, while detailed molecular characterization in any well clinically characterized patient is expected to track down individual candidate genes for the specific features of the syndrome.
17998203	Thioredoxin-interacting protein (Txnip) is a critical regulator of hepatic glucose production.	Thioredoxin-interacting protein (Txnip) has been recently described as a possible link between cellular redox state and metabolism; Txnip binds thioredoxin and inhibits its disulfide reductase activity in vitro, while a naturally occurring strain of Txnip-deficient mice has hyperlipidemia, hypoglycemia, and ketosis exacerbated by fasting. We generated Txnip-null mice to investigate the role of Txnip in glucose homeostasis. Txnip-null mice were hypoglycemic, hypoinsulinemic, and had blunted glucose production following a glucagon challenge, consistent with a central liver glucose-handling defect. Glucose release from isolated Txnip-null hepatocytes was 2-fold lower than wild-type hepatocytes, whereas beta-hydroxybutyrate release was increased 2-fold, supporting an intrinsic defect in hepatocyte glucose metabolism. While hepatocyte-specific gene deletion of Txnip did not alter glucose clearance compared with littermate controls, Txnip expression in the liver was required for maintaining normal fasting glycemia and glucose production. In addition, hepatic overexpression of a Txnip transgene in wild-type mice resulted in elevated serum glucose levels and decreased ketone levels. Liver homogenates from Txnip-null mice had no significant differences in the glutathione oxidation state or in the amount of available thioredoxin. However, overexpression of wild-type Txnip in Txnip-null hepatocytes rescued cellular glucose production, whereas overexpression of a C247S mutant Txnip, which does not bind thioredoxin, had no effect. These data demonstrate that Txnip is required for normal glucose homeostasis in the liver. While available thioredoxin is not changed in Txnip-null mice, the effects of Txnip on glucose homeostasis are abolished by a single cysteine mutation that inhibits binding to thioredoxin.
17998210	Conformational transitions in adenylate kinase. Allosteric communication reduces misligation.	Large conformational changes in the LID and NMP domains of adenylate kinase (AKE) are known to be key to ligand binding and catalysis, yet the order of binding events and domain motion is not well understood. Combining the multiple available structures for AKE with the energy landscape theory for protein folding, a theoretical model was developed for allostery, order of binding events, and efficient catalysis. Coarse-grained models and nonlinear normal mode analysis were used to infer that intrinsic structural fluctuations dominate LID motion, whereas ligand-protein interactions and cracking (local unfolding) are more important during NMP motion. In addition, LID-NMP domain interactions are indispensable for efficient catalysis. LID domain motion precedes NMP domain motion, during both opening and closing. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the observed 1:1:1 correspondence between LID domain closure, NMP domain closure, and substrate turnover. This catalytic cycle has likely evolved to reduce misligation, and thus inhibition, of AKE. The separation of allosteric motion into intrinsic structural fluctuations and ligand-induced contributions can be generalized to further our understanding of allosteric transitions in other proteins.
17998287	Identification and characterization of a tRNA decoding the rare AUA codon in Haloarcula marismortui.	Annotation of the complete genome of the extreme halophilic archaeon Haloarcula marismortui does not include a tRNA for translation of AUA, the rare codon for isoleucine. This is a situation typical for most archaeal genomes sequenced to date. Based on computational analysis, it has been proposed recently that a single intron-containing tRNA gene produces two very similar but functionally different tRNAs by means of alternative splicing; a UGG-decoding tRNA(TrpCCA) and an AUA-decoding tRNA(IleUAU). Through analysis of tRNAs from H. marismortui, we have confirmed the presence of tRNA(TrpCCA), but found no evidence for the presence of tRNA(IleUAU). Instead, we have shown that a tRNA, currently annotated as elongator methionine tRNA and containing CAU as the anticodon, is aminoacylated with isoleucine in vivo and that this tRNA represents the missing isoleucine tRNA. Interestingly, this tRNA carries a base modification of C34 in the anticodon different from the well-known lysidine found in eubacteria, which switches the amino acid identity of the tRNA from methionine to isoleucine and its decoding specificity from AUG to AUA. The methods described in this work for the identification of individual tRNAs present in H. marismortui provide the tools necessary for experimentally confirming the presence of any tRNA in a cell and, thereby, to test computational predictions of tRNA genes.
17998308	Effects of CXCL10 on dendritic cell and CD4+ T-cell functions during Leishmania amazonensis infection.	Leishmania amazonensis can cause progressive disease in most inbred strains of mice. We have previously reported that treatment with CXCL10 activates macrophage (MPhi) effector function(s) in parasite killing and significantly delays lesion development in susceptible C57BL/6 mice via enhanced gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) and interleukin 12 (IL-12) secretion; however, the mechanism underlying this enhanced immunity against L. amazonensis infection remains largely unresolved. In this study, we utilized stationary promastigotes to infect bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DCs) of C57BL/6 mice and assessed the activation of DC subsets and the capacity of these DC subsets to prime CD4+ T cells in vitro. We found that CXCL10 induced IL-12 p40 production but reduced IL-10 production in uninfected DCs. Yet L. amazonensis-infected DCs produced elevated levels of IL-10 despite CXCL10 treatment. Elimination of endogenous IL-10 led to increased IL-12 p40 production in DCs as well as increased proliferation and IFN-gamma production by in vitro-primed CD4+ T cells. In addition, CXCL10-treated CD4+ T cells became more responsive to IL-12 via increased expression of the IL-12 receptor beta2 chain and produced elevated levels of IFN-gamma. This report indicates the utility of CXCL10 in generating a Th1-favored, proinflammatory response, which is a prerequisite for controlling Leishmania infection.
17999057	Clinical use and pharmacological properties of selective COX-2 inhibitors.	Selective COX-2 inhibitors (coxibs) are approved for the relief of acute pain and symptoms of chronic inflammatory conditions such as osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). They have similar pharmacological properties but a slightly improved gastrointestinal (GI) safety profile if compared to traditional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (tNSAIDs). However, long-term use of coxibs can be associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular (CV) adverse events (AEs). For this reason, two coxibs were withdrawn from the market. Currently celecoxib, etoricoxib, and lumiracoxib are used. These three coxibs differ in their chemical structure and selectivity for COX-2, which might explain some of their pharmacological features. Following oral administration, the less lipophilic celecoxib has a lower bioavailability (20-40%) than the other two coxibs (74-100%). All are eliminated by hepatic metabolism involving mainly CYP2C9 (celecoxib, lumiracoxib) and CYP3A4 (etoricoxib). Elimination half-life varies from 5 to 8 h (lumiracoxib), 11 to 16 h (celecoxib) and 19 to 32 h (etoricoxib). In patients with liver disease, plasma levels of celecoxib and etoricoxib are increased about two-fold. Clinical efficacies of the coxibs are comparable to tNSAIDs. There is an ongoing discussion about whether the slightly better GI tolerability (which is lost if acetylsalicylic acid is coadministered) of the coxibs is offset by their elevated risks for CV AEs (also seen with tNSAIDs other than naproxen), which apparently increase with dose and duration of exposure. In addition, the higher costs for coxibs (if compared to tNSAIDs, even when a "gastroprotective" proton pump inhibitor is coadministered) should be taken into consideration, if a coxib will be selected for certain patients with a high risk for GI complications. For such treatment, the lowest effective dose should be used for a limited time. Monitoring of kidney function and blood pressure appears advisable. It is hoped that further controlled studies can better define the therapeutic place of the coxibs.
17999412	A stromal gene signature associated with inflammatory breast cancer.	The factors that determine whether a breast carcinoma will develop into inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) remain poorly understood. Recent evidence indicates that the tumor stroma influences cancer phenotypes. We tested the hypotheses that the gene expression signature of the tumor stroma is a distinctive feature of IBC. We used laser capture microdissection to obtain enriched populations of tumor epithelial cells and adjacent stromal cells from 15 patients with IBC and 35 patients with invasive, noninflammatory breast cancer (non-IBC). Their mRNA expression profiles were assessed using Affymetrix GeneChips. In addition, a previously established classifier for IBC was evaluated for the resulting data sets. The gene expression profile of the tumor stroma distinguished IBC from non-IBC, and a previously established IBC prediction signature performed better in classifying IBC using the gene expression profile of the tumor stroma than it did using the profile of the tumor epithelium. In a pathway analysis, the genes differentially expressed between IBC and non-IBC tumors clustered in distinct pathways. We identified multiple pathways related to the endoplasmic stress response that could be functionally significant in IBC. Our findings suggest that the gene expression in the tumor stroma may play a role in determining the IBC phenotype.
17999635	Oxidative stress and antioxidants in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis: a potential role for Nrf2.	Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic progressive disorder in which excessive deposition of extracellular matrix leads to irreversible scarring of interstitial lung tissue. The etiology of IPF remains unknown, but growing evidence suggests that disequilibrium in oxidant/antioxidant balance contributes significantly. IPF is currently regarded as a fibroproliferative disorder triggered by repeated alveolar epithelial cell injury. Oxidative stress plays a role in many processes involved in alveolar epithelial cell injury and fibrogenesis. Here we review the role of oxidative stress in IPF, and other forms of pulmonary fibrosis, with particular attention to antioxidant defenses regulated by the redox-sensitive transcription factor nuclear factor, erythroid derived 2, like (Nrf2). Nrf2 binds specific antioxidant response elements (AREs) in the promoter of antioxidant enzyme and defense protein genes and regulates their expression in many tissue types. Nrf2 protects from several phenotypes in which enhanced oxidative burden contributes to disease pathogenesis, including cancer, acute lung injury, and pulmonary fibrosis. We suggest that promoter polymorphisms in human NRF2 may contribute to IPF susceptibility, although this hypothesis has not been tested. Pulmonary fibrosis is a highly complex disease and involves multiple genes and processes, and new therapies for cellular and molecular targets involved in pathogenic mechanisms are needed.
17999723	Amphibians do not follow Bergmann's rule.	The tendency for organisms to be larger in cooler climates (Bergmann's rule) is widely observed in endotherms, and has been reputed to apply to some ectotherms including amphibians. However, recent reports provide conflicting support for the pattern, questioning whether Bergmann's clines are generally present in amphibians. In this study, we measured 96,996 adult Plethodon from 3974 populations to test for the presence of Bergmann's clines in these salamanders. Only three Plethodon species exhibited a significant negative correlation between body size and temperature consistent with Bergmann's rule, whereas 37 of 40 species did not display a pattern consistent with this prediction. Further, a phylogenetic comparative analysis found no relationship between body size and temperature among species. A meta-analysis combining our data with the available data for other amphibian species revealed no support for Bergmann's rule at the genus (Plethodon), order (Caudata), or class (Amphibia) levels. Our findings strongly suggest that negative thermal body size clines are not common in amphibians, and we conclude that Bergmann's rule is not generally applicable to these taxa. Thus, evolutionary explanations of Bergmann's clines in other tetrapods need not account for unique life-history attributes of amphibians.
17999932	Three-dimensional structure of a putative non-cellulosomal cohesin module from a Clostridium perfringens family 84 glycoside hydrolase.	The genomes of myonecrotic strains of Clostridium perfringens encode a large number of secreted glycoside hydrolases. The activities of these enzymes are consistent with degradation of the mucosal layer of the human gastrointestinal tract, glycosaminoglycans and other cellular glycans found throughout the body. In many cases this is thought to aid in the propagation of the major toxins produced by C. perfringens. One such example is the family 84 glycoside hydrolases, which contains five C. perfringens members (CpGH84A-E), each displaying a unique modular architecture. The smallest and most extensively studied member, CpGH84C, comprises an N-terminal catalytic domain with beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase activity, a family 32 carbohydrate-binding module, a family 82 X-module (X82) of unknown function, and a fibronectin type-III-like module. Here we present the structure of the X82 module from CpGH84C, determined by both NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. CpGH84C X82 adopts a jell-roll fold comprising two beta-sheets formed by nine beta-strands. CpGH84C X82 displays distant amino acid sequence identity yet close structural similarity to the cohesin modules of cellulolytic anaerobic bacteria. Cohesin modules are responsible for the assembly of numerous hydrolytic enzymes in a cellulose-degrading multi-enzyme complex, termed the cellulosome, through a high-affinity interaction with the calcium-binding dockerin module. A planar surface is located on the face of the CpGH84 X82 structure that corresponds to the dockerin-binding region of cellulolytic cohesin modules and has the approximate dimensions to accommodate a dockerin module. The presence of cohesin-like X82 modules in glycoside hydrolases of C. perfringens is an indication that the formation of novel X82-dockerin mediated multi-enzyme complexes, with potential roles in pathogenesis, is possible.
17999995	DIMA 2.0--predicted and known domain interactions.	DIMA-the domain interaction map has evolved from a simple web server for domain phylogenetic profiling into an integrative prediction resource combining both experimental data on domain-domain interactions and predictions from two different algorithms. With this update, DIMA obtains greatly improved coverage at the level of genomes and domains as well as with respect to available prediction approaches. The domain phylogenetic profiling method now uses SIMAP as its backend for exhaustive domain hit coverage: 7038 Pfam domains were profiled over 460 completely sequenced genomes. Domain pair exclusion predictions were produced from 83 969 distinct protein-protein interactions obtained from IntAct resulting in 21 513 domain pairs with significant domain pair exclusion algorithm scores. Additional predictions applying the same algorithm to predicted protein interactions from STRING yielded 2378 high-confidence pairs. Experimental data comes from iPfam (3074) and 3did (3034 pairs), two databases identifying domain contacts in solved protein structures. Taken together, these two resources yielded 3653 distinct interacting domain pairs. DIMA is available at http://mips.gsf.de/genre/proj/dima.
18000001	The process of displacing the single-stranded DNA-binding protein from single-stranded DNA by RecO and RecR proteins.	The regions of single-stranded (ss) DNA that result from DNA damage are immediately coated by the ssDNA-binding protein (SSB). RecF pathway proteins facilitate the displacement of SSB from ssDNA, allowing the RecA protein to form protein filaments on the ssDNA region, which facilitates the process of recombinational DNA repair. In this study, we examined the mechanism of SSB displacement from ssDNA using purified Thermus thermophilus RecF pathway proteins. To date, RecO and RecR are thought to act as the RecOR complex. However, our results indicate that RecO and RecR have distinct functions. We found that RecR binds both RecF and RecO, and that RecO binds RecR, SSB and ssDNA. The electron microscopic studies indicated that SSB is displaced from ssDNA by RecO. In addition, pull-down assays indicated that the displaced SSB still remains indirectly attached to ssDNA through its interaction with RecO in the RecO-ssDNA complex. In the presence of both SSB and RecO, the ssDNA-dependent ATPase activity of RecA was inhibited, but was restored by the addition of RecR. Interestingly, the interaction of RecR with RecO affected the ssDNA-binding properties of RecO. These results suggest a model of SSB displacement from the ssDNA by RecF pathway proteins.
18000006	Ensembl 2008.	The Ensembl project (http://www.ensembl.org) is a comprehensive genome information system featuring an integrated set of genome annotation, databases and other information for chordate and selected model organism and disease vector genomes. As of release 47 (October 2007), Ensembl fully supports 35 species, with preliminary support for six additional species. New species in the past year include platypus and horse. Major additions and improvements to Ensembl since our previous report include extensive support for functional genomics data in the form of a specialized functional genomics database, genome-wide maps of protein-DNA interactions and the Ensembl regulatory build; support for customization of the Ensembl web interface through the addition of user accounts and user groups; and increased support for genome resequencing. We have also introduced new comparative genomics-based data mining options and report on the continued development of our software infrastructure.
18000015	Correlated substitution analysis and the prediction of amino acid structural contacts.	It has long been suspected that analysis of correlated amino acid substitutions should uncover pairs or clusters of sites that are spatially proximal in mature protein structures. Accordingly, methods based on different mathematical principles such as information theory, correlation coefficients and maximum likelihood have been developed to identify co-evolving amino acids from multiple sequence alignments. Sets of pairs of sites whose behaviour is identified by these methods as correlated are often significantly enriched in pairs of spatially proximal residues. However, relatively high levels of false-positive predictions typically render such methods, in isolation, of little use in the ab initio prediction of protein structure. Misleading signal (or problems with the estimation of significance levels) can be caused by phylogenetic correlations between homologous sequences and from correlation due to factors other than spatial proximity (for example, correlation of sites which are not spatially close but which are involved in common functional properties of the protein). In recent years, several workers have suggested that information from correlated substitutions should be combined with other sources of information (secondary structure, solvent accessibility, evolutionary rates) in an attempt to reduce the proportion of false-positive predictions. We review methods for the detection of correlated amino acid substitutions, compare their relative performance in contact prediction and predict future directions in the field.
18000031	Repression of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) signaling by AHR repressor: role of DNA binding and competition for AHR nuclear translocator.	Activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin causes altered gene expression and toxicity. The AHR repressor (AHRR) inhibits AHR signaling through a proposed mechanism involving competition with AHR for dimerization with AHR nuclear translocator (ARNT) and binding to AHR-responsive enhancer elements (AHREs). We sought to delineate the relative roles of competition for ARNT and AHREs in the mechanism of repression. In transient transfections in which AHR2-dependent transactivation was repressed by AHRR1 or AHRR2, increasing ARNT expression failed to reverse the repression, suggesting that AHRR inhibition of AHR signaling does not occur through sequestration of ARNT. An AHRR1 point mutant (AHRR1-Y9F) that could not bind to AHREs but that retained its nuclear localization was only slightly reduced in its ability to repress AHR2, demonstrating that AHRR repression does not occur solely through competition for AHREs. When both proposed mechanisms were blocked (AHRR1-Y9F plus excess ARNT), AHRR remained functional. AHRR1 neither blocked AHR nuclear translocation nor reduced the levels of AHR2 protein. Experiments using AHRR1 C-terminal deletion mutants showed that amino acids 270 to 550 are dispensable for repression. These results demonstrate that repression of AHR transactivation by AHRR involves the N-terminal portion of AHRR; does not involve competition for ARNT; and does not require binding to AHREs, although AHRE binding can contribute to the repression. We propose a mechanism of AHRR action involving "transrepression" of AHR signaling through protein-protein interactions rather than by inhibition of the formation or DNA binding of the AHR-ARNT complex.
18000032	Degradation of hypomodified tRNA(iMet) in vivo involves RNA-dependent ATPase activity of the DExH helicase Mtr4p.	Effective turnover of many incorrectly processed RNAs in yeast, including hypomodified tRNA(iMet), requires the TRAMP complex, which appends a short poly(A) tail to RNA designated for decay. The poly(A) tail stimulates degradation by the exosome. The TRAMP complex contains the poly(A) polymerase Trf4p, the RNA-binding protein Air2p, and the DExH RNA helicase Mtr4p. The role of Mtr4p in RNA degradation processes involving the TRAMP complex has been unclear. Here we show through a genetic analysis that MTR4 is required for degradation but not for polyadenylation of hypomodified tRNA(iMet). A suppressor of the trm6-504 mutation in the tRNA m(1)A58 methyltransferase (Trm6p/Trm61p), which causes a reduced level of tRNA(iMet), was mapped to MTR4. This mtr4-20 mutation changed a single amino acid in the conserved helicase motif VI of Mtr4p. The mutation stabilizes hypomodified tRNA(iMet) in vivo but has no effect on TRAMP complex stability or polyadenylation activity in vivo or in vitro. We further show that purified recombinant Mtr4p displays RNA-dependent ATPase activity and unwinds RNA duplexes with a 3'-to-5' polarity in an ATP-dependent fashion. Unwinding and RNA-stimulated ATPase activities are strongly reduced in the recombinant mutant Mtr4-20p, suggesting that these activities of Mtr4p are critical for degradation of polyadenylated hypomodified tRNA(iMet).
18000089	Short-term exercise improves beta-cell function and insulin resistance in older people with impaired glucose tolerance.	BACKGROUND: There is a high prevalence of diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) in the older population. Normal aging is associated with insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion, with greater defects in people with IGT. Short-term exercise has been found to increase insulin sensitivity, but little is known about acute exercise effects on beta-cell function in older people with IGT. METHODS: We assessed the effects of 7 consecutive days of supervised aerobic exercise (1 h/d at 60-70% heart rate reserve) in 12 sedentary older people with IGT. Screening included oral glucose tolerance test, stress/maximal O(2) uptake test, and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scan. Participants had a frequently sampled iv glucose tolerance test at baseline and 15-20 h after the seventh exercise session. Insulin sensitivity (S(I)), glucose disappearance constant (Kg, a measure of iv glucose tolerance), acute insulin response to glucose (AIRg), and disposition index (AIRg x S(I)), a measure of beta-cell function in relation to insulin resistance, were calculated. RESULTS: Exercise was well tolerated. Body weight, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and iv glucose tolerance were unchanged with exercise. S(I) increased by 59%, AIRg decreased by 12%, and disposition index increased by 31%. There was no significant change in fasting lipid, catecholamine, leptin, or adiponectin levels. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term exercise not only improved insulin resistance but also significantly enhanced beta-cell function in older people with IGT. These effects of short-term exercise on beta-cell function cannot be explained by changes in body weight or circulating levels of lipids, leptin, adiponectin, or catecholamines.
18000325	LEGClust- a clustering algorithm based on layered entropic subgraphs.	Hierarchical clustering is a stepwise clustering method usually based on proximity measures between objects or sets of objects from a given data set. The most common proximity measures are distance measures. The derived proximity matrices can be used to build graphs, which provide the basic structure for some clustering methods. We present here a new proximity matrix based on an entropic measure and also a clustering algorithm (LEGClust) that builds layers of subgraphs based on this matrix, and uses them and a hierarchical agglomerative clustering technique to form the clusters. Our approach capitalizes on both a graph structure and a hierarchical construction. Moreover, by using entropy as a proximity measure we are able, with no assumption about the cluster shapes, to capture the local structure of the data, forcing the clustering method to reflect this structure. We present several experiments on artificial and real data sets that provide evidence on the superior performance of this new algorithm when compared with competing ones.
18000659	The effects of CYP3A4 inhibition on erlotinib pharmacokinetics: computer-based simulation (SimCYP) predicts in vivo metabolic inhibition.	BACKGROUND: Erlotinib is an orally active antitumor agent. Analyses in vitro using human liver microsomes and recombinant enzymes showed that erlotinib was metabolized primarily by CYP3A4, with a secondary contribution from CYP1A2. METHODS: A computer-based simulation model, SimCYP, predicted that CYP3A4 contributed to approximately 70% of the metabolic elimination of erlotinib, with CYP1A2 being responsible for the other approximately 30%. A drug-drug interaction study was therefore conducted for erlotinib and a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole, in healthy male volunteers to evaluate the impact of CYP3A4 inhibition on erlotinib exposure. RESULTS: Ketoconazole caused an almost two-fold increase in erlotinib plasma area under the concentration curve and in maximum plasma concentration. This is consistent with the SimCYP prediction of a two-fold increase in erlotinib AUC, further validating a primary (approximately 70%) role of CYP3A4 in erlotinib elimination. CONCLUSION: Prediction of clinically important drug-drug interaction with SimCYP using in vitro human metabolism data can be a powerful tool during early clinical development to ensure safe administration of anticancer drugs, which are often co-administered at maximum tolerated doses with other drugs as part of a palliative treatment regimen.
18000682	The Pallister-Killian syndrome in a child with rare karyotype--a diagnostic problem.	The Pallister-Killian syndrome is a clinically recognizable syndrome, usually due to a tissue-specific mosaicism for a 12p isochromosome [i(12p)]. We report a rare case of Pallister-Killian syndrome with 12p mosaicism, tetrasomy/trisomy/disomy in fibroblasts and trisomy/disomy in lymphocytes. Marker chromosomes were investigated with conventional cytogenetic techniques and fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH). The karyotype was established as: mos47,XX,+12p/47,XX,+i(12p)/46,XX. The cytogenetic result of the extra mosaic 12p presented in lymphocytes suggested the diagnosis of trisomy 12p, although, in combination with clinical manifestations, the Pallister-Killian syndrome was considered and confirmed by the cytogenetic analysis of fibroblasts.
18000754	Dynamic changes in brain activations and functional connectivity during affectively different tactile stimuli.	In the present study, we compared brain activations produced by pleasant, neutral and unpleasant touch, to the anterior lateral surface of lower leg of human subjects. It was found that several brain regions, including the contralateral primary somatosensory area (SI), bilateral secondary somatosensory area (SII), as well as contralateral middle and posterior insula cortex were commonly activated under the three touch conditions. In addition, pleasant and unpleasant touch conditions shared a few brain regions including the contralateral posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and bilateral premotor cortex (PMC). Unpleasant touch specifically activated a set of pain-related brain regions such as contralateral supplementary motor area (SMA) and dorsal parts of bilateral anterior cingulated cortex, etc. Brain regions specifically activated by pleasant touch comprised bilateral lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), intraparietal cortex and left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Using a novel functional connectivity model based on graph theory, we showed that a series of brain regions related to affectively different touch had significant functional connectivity during the resting state. Furthermore, it was found that such a network can be modulated between affectively different touch conditions.
18000842	Improving sequence variant descriptions in mutation databases and literature using the Mutalyzer sequence variation nomenclature checker.	Unambiguous and correct sequence variant descriptions are of utmost importance, not in the least since mistakes and uncertainties may lead to undesired errors in clinical diagnosis. We developed the Mutation Analyzer (Mutalyzer) sequence variation nomenclature checker (www.lovd.nl/mutalyzer; last accessed 13 September 2007) for automated analysis and correction of sequence variant descriptions using reference sequences from any organism. Mutalyzer handles most variation types: substitution, deletion, duplication, insertion, indel, and splice-site changes following current recommendations of the Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS). Input is a GenBank accession number or an uploaded reference sequence file in GenBank format with user-modified annotation, an HGNC gene symbol, and the variant (single or in a batch file). Mutalyzer generates variant descriptions at DNA level, the level of all annotated transcripts and the deduced outcome at protein level. To validate Mutalyzer's performance and to investigate the sequence variant description quality in locus-specific mutation databases (LSDBs), more than 11,000 variants in the PAH, BIC BRCA2, and HbVar databases were analyzed, showing that 87%, 25%, and 38%, respectively, were error-free and following the recommendations. Low recognition rates in BIC and HbVar (38% and 51%, respectively) were due to lack of a well-annotated genomic reference sequence (HbVar) or noncompliance to the guidelines (BRCA2). Provided with well-annotated genomic reference sequences, Mutalyzer is very effective for the curation of newly discovered sequence variation descriptions and existing LSDB data. Mutalyzer will be linked to the Leiden Open source Variation Database (LOVD) (www.LOVD.nl; last accessed 13 September 2007) and is the first module of a sequence variant effect prediction package.
18000862	A novel AF9 breakpoint in MLL-AF9-positive acute monoblastic leukemia.	MLL-AF9 is the most frequent MLL rearrangement in childhood acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and it may be also found in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) of patients younger than 1-year-old (infants). We report a novel AF9 breakpoint site, located between previously reported sites A and B, detected in an infant who was diagnosed with AML-FAB M5. The occurrence of this new breakpoint should be considered when designing RT-PCR assays for the screening of MLL abnormalities. The precise characterization of the MLL-AF9 transcript is important to carry out the minimal residual disease analysis during the follow-up of the patients.
18000881	Modulation of actin mechanics by caldesmon and tropomyosin.	The ability of cells to sense and respond to physiological forces relies on the actin cytoskeleton, a dynamic structure that can directly convert forces into biochemical signals. Because of the association of muscle actin-binding proteins (ABPs) may affect F-actin and hence cytoskeleton mechanics, we investigated the effects of several ABPs on the mechanical properties of the actin filaments. The structural interactions between ABPs and helical actin filaments can vary between interstrand interactions that bridge azimuthally adjacent actin monomers between filament strands (i.e. by molecular stapling as proposed for caldesmon) or, intrastrand interactions that reinforce axially adjacent actin monomers along strands (i.e. as in the interaction of tropomyosin with actin). Here, we analyzed thermally driven fluctuations in actin's shape to measure the flexural rigidity of actin filaments with different ABPs bound. We show that the binding of phalloidin increases the persistence length of actin by 1.9-fold. Similarly, the intrastrand reinforcement by smooth and skeletal muscle tropomyosins increases the persistence length 1.5- and 2- fold respectively. We also show that the interstrand crosslinking by the C-terminal actin-binding fragment of caldesmon, H32K, increases persistence length by 1.6-fold. While still remaining bound to actin, phosphorylation of H32K by ERK abolishes the molecular staple (Foster et al. 2004. J Biol Chem 279;53387-53394) and reduces filament rigidity to that of actin with no ABPs bound. Lastly, we show that the effect of binding both smooth muscle tropomyosin and H32K is not additive. The combination of structural and mechanical studies on ABP-actin interactions will help provide information about the biophysical mechanism of force transduction in cells.
18001722	Molecular analysis of the WNT4 gene in 6 patients with Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome.	Molecular analysis of the WNT4 gene in 6 patients with Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome without androgen excess excluded this gene as a major cause of this syndrome, regardless of the subtype.
18001851	Real-time RT-PCR assay for rapid and specific detection of classical swine fever virus: comparison of SYBR Green and TaqMan MGB detection methods using novel MGB probes.	Real-time PCR is an accurate, rapid and reliable method that can be used for the detection and also for the quantitation of specific DNA molecules. The basic principle is the recurring measurement of a fluorescent signal, which is proportional to the amount of amplification product. In our trial two detection systems were tested for classical swine fever virus (CSFV) detection and for its discrimination from other pestiviruses; non-specific dsDNA-binding dye SYBR Green and specific fluorogenic TaqMan MGB probes. Real-time RT-PCR assays were evaluated for diagnostic sensitivity and specificity by different pestiviral reference and field strains. With both approaches, SYBR Green and TaqMan probes, respectively, all of the CSFV strains isolated on cell culture were detected and also clearly distinguished from other pestiviruses. However, the established one-step real-time TaqMan RT-PCR assay was shown to be more appropriate for pestivirus quantitation, it reduces the risk of contamination and is less time consuming.
18003614	Phosphorylation of the human retinoid X receptor alpha at serine 260 impairs coactivator(s) recruitment and induces hormone resistance to multiple ligands.	The retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRalpha) is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily that regulates transcription of target genes through heterodimerization with several partners, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, retinoic acid receptor, thyroid receptor, and vitamin D receptor (VDR). We have shown previously that signaling through VDR.RXRalpha heterodimers was attenuated in ras-transformed keratinocytes due to phosphorylation of serine 260 of the RXRalpha via the activated Ras-Raf-MAPK cascade in these cells. In this study we demonstrate that phosphorylation at serine 260, a site located in the omega loop-AF-2 interacting domain of RXRalpha, inhibits signaling through several heterodimeric partners of the RXRalpha. The inhibition of signaling results in reduced transactivational response to ligand presentation and the reduced physiological response of growth inhibition not only of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 but also of retinoic acid receptor alpha ligands and LG1069 (an RXRalpha ligand). This partial resistance to ligands could be reversed by inhibition of MAPK activity or by overexpression of a non-phosphorylable RXRalpha mutant at serine 260 (RXRalpha Ser-260-->Ala). Importantly, phosphorylation of RXRalpha at serine 260 impaired the recruitment of DRIP205 and other coactivators to the VDR.RXRalpha complex. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and pulldown assays further demonstrated that coactivator recruitment to the VDR.RXR complex could be restored by treatment with a MAPK inhibitor. Our data suggest that phosphorylation at serine 260 plays a critical role in inducing hormone resistance of RXRalpha-mediated signaling likely through structural changes in the H1-H3 omega loop-AF2 coactivator(s) interacting domain.
18003617	Analysis of the nitric oxide-sensing non-heme iron center in the NorR regulatory protein.	The NorR regulatory protein senses nitric oxide (NO) to activate genes required for NO detoxification under anaerobic and microaerobic conditions in Escherichia coli. NorR belongs to the sigma(54)-dependent family of transcriptional activators and contains an N-terminal regulatory GAF (cGMP phosphodiesterase, adenylate cyclase, FhlA) domain that controls the ATPase activity of the central AAA+ domain to regulate productive interactions with sigma(54). Binding of NO to a non-heme iron center in the GAF domain results in the formation of a mononitrosyl-iron complex and releases intramolecular repression of the AAA+ domain to enable activation of transcription. In this study, we have further characterized NorR spectroscopically and substituted conserved residues in the GAF domain. This analysis, in combination with structural modeling of the GAF domain, has identified five candidate ligands to the non-heme iron and suggests a model in which the metal ion is coordinated in a pseudo-octahedral environment by three aspartate residues, an arginine, and a cysteine.
18003654	The 20 years of PROSITE.	PROSITE consists of documentation entries describing protein domains, families and functional sites, as well as associated patterns and profiles to identify them. It is complemented by ProRule, a collection of rules based on profiles and patterns, which increases the discriminatory power of profiles and patterns by providing additional information about functionally and/or structurally critical amino acids. In this article, we describe the implementation of a new method to assign a status to pattern matches, the new PROSITE web page and a new approach to improve the specificity and sensitivity of PROSITE methods. The latest version of PROSITE (release 20.19 of 11 September 2007) contains 1319 patterns, 745 profiles and 764 ProRules. Over the past 2 years, about 200 domains have been added, and now 53% of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entries (release 54.2 of 11 September 2007) have a PROSITE match. PROSITE is available on the web at: http://www.expasy.org/prosite/.
18003764	Value of a complete or partial remission in severe lupus nephritis.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The value of a complete remission in severe lupus nephritis is well known but little is known about the impact of a partial remission in this patient population. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term prognosis of achieving a complete or partial remission in a well-defined group of patients with severe lupus nephritis. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: In this study, 86 patients with diffuse lupus glomerulonephritis were reviewed for assessment of the value of a partial remission (50% reduction in baseline proteinuria to < or =1.5 g/d and < or =25% increase in baseline creatinine) and complete remission (proteinuria < or =0.33 g/d and serum creatinine < or =1.4 mg/dl) on outcomes compared with patients who did not attain a remission. These well-characterized patients were entered into a prospective therapeutic trial conducted by the Collaborative Study Group and were followed for more than 10 yr. RESULTS: All biopsies showed diffuse lupus nephritis. A complete remission was attained in 37 (43%) patients, a partial remission in 21 (24%) patients, and no remission in 28 (32%) patients. Baseline clinical and serologic features were similar among the groups, but patients with a complete remission had a lower serum creatinine and chronicity index compared with patients with partial or no remission. The patient survival at 10 yr was 95% for complete remission, 76% for partial remission, and 46% for no remission. The renal survival at 10 yr was 94% for complete remission, 45% for partial remission, and 19% for no remission, and the patient survival without end-stage renal disease at 10 yr was 92% for complete remission, 43% for partial remission, and 13% for no remission. CONCLUSION: Even a partial remission in lupus nephritis is associated with a significantly better patient and renal survival compared with no remission.
18003799	Evaluation of a Chlamydophila psittaci infection diagnostic platform for zoonotic risk assessment.	Reports on zoonotic transmission of Chlamydophila psittaci originating from poultry are incidentally published. During recent studies in European turkeys we isolated C. psittaci genotypes A, B, D, E, F, and E/B, all considered potentially dangerous for humans. This encouraged us to analyze the zoonotic risk on a Belgian turkey farm, from production onset until slaughter, using a Chlamydophila psittaci diagnostic platform. Twenty individually marked hens, as well as the farmer and two scientists, were monitored medically. Bioaerosol monitoring, serology, isolation, and nested PCR demonstrated chlamydiosis on the farm leading to symptomatic psittacosis in all 3 persons involved. ompA sequencing confirmed the zoonotic transmission of C. psittaci genotype A. Strangely, two different antibody microimmunofluorescence (MIF) tests remained negative in all infected persons. The results demonstrate the value of the currently used diagnostic platform in demonstrating C. psittaci infections in both birds and humans but raise questions regarding use of the MIF test for diagnosing human psittacosis. In addition, our results suggest the underestimation of psittacosis in the poultry industry, stressing the need for a veterinary vaccine and recommendations for zoonotic risk reduction strategies.
18003889	Metabolism of diffuse intrinsic brainstem gliomas in children.	Progress in the development of effective therapies for diffuse intrinsic brainstem gliomas (DIBSGs) is compromised by the unavailability of tissue samples and the lack of noninvasive markers that can characterize disease status. The purpose of this study was to compare the metabolic profile of DIBSGs with that of astrocytomas elsewhere in the CNS and to determine whether the measurement of metabolic features can improve the assessment of disease status. Forty in vivo MR spectroscopy (MRS) studies of 16 patients with DIBSG at baseline and after radiation therapy were retrospectively reviewed. Control data for baseline studies of DIBSGs were obtained from 14 untreated regular and anaplastic astrocytomas. All spectra were acquired with single-voxel, short echo-time (35 ms), point-resolved spectroscopy. Absolute metabolite concentrations (mmol/kg) and lipid intensities (arbitrary units) were determined. At baseline, creatine and total choline (tCho) were significantly lower in DIBSGs than in astrocytomas elsewhere in the CNS (4.3 +/- 1.1 vs. 7.5 +/- 1.9 mmol/kg, p < 0.001; 1.9 +/- 0.7 vs. 4.2 +/- 2.6, p < 0.001). Serial MRS in individual subjects revealed increasing levels of tCho (p < 0.05) and lipids (p < 0.05) and reduced ratios of N-acetylaspartate, creatine, and myoinositol relative to tCho (all p < 0.01). Metabolic progression defined by increased tCho concentration in serial MRS preceded clinical deterioration by 2.4 +/- 2.7 months (p < 0.04). Low tCho of DIBSG at baseline is consistent with low proliferative tumors. Subsequent metabolic changes that have been associated with malignant degeneration preceded clinical deterioration. MRS provides early surrogate markers for disease progression.
18003890	Gene expression analyses of grade II gliomas and identification of rPTPbeta/zeta as a candidate oligodendroglioma marker.	Grade II gliomas are morphologically and clinically heterogeneous tumors for which histopathological typing remains the major tool for clinical classification. To what extent the major histological subtypes - astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas, and oligoastrocytomas - constitute true biological entities is largely unresolved. Furthermore, morphological classification is often ambiguous and would be facilitated by specific subtype markers. In this study, 23 grade II gliomas were expression-profiled and subjected to hierarchical clustering. All six oligodendrogliomas were grouped together in one of two major clusters; a significant correlation was thus observed between gene expression and histopathological subtype. Supervised analyses were performed to identify genes differentiating oligodendrogliomas from other grade II tumors. In a leave-one-out test using 10 features for classification, 20 out of 23 tumors were correctly classified. Among the most differentially expressed genes was rPTPbeta/zeta. The expression of the rPTP beta/zeta protein in oligodendrogliomas and astrocytomas was further validated by immunohistochemistry in an independent set of tumors. All 11 oligodendrogliomas of this set displayed strong staining. In contrast, neoplastic astrocytes were mostly negative for rPTPbeta/zeta staining. In summary, this study demonstrates a correlation between gene expression pattern and histological subtype in grade II gliomas. Furthermore, the results from the immunohistochemical analyses of rPTPbeta/zeta expression should prompt further evaluation of this protein as a novel oligodendroglioma marker.
18004294	Decreased renal ischemia-reperfusion injury by IL-16 inactivation.	T-cell-mediated renal injury is a major cause of kidney transplant rejection and renal failure; hence, understanding T-cell migration within the kidney is important for preventing renal injury. Interleukin (IL)-16 is a T-cell chemoattractant produced by leukocytes. Here we measured IL-16 expression in the kidney and its role in renal ischemia-reperfusion injury induced by different conditions in several strains of mice. IL-16 was strongly expressed in distal and proximal straight tubules of the kidney. The IL-16 precursor protein was cleaved to a chemotactic form in cultured tubular epithelial cells. Inactivation of IL-16 by antibody therapy or IL-16 deficiency prevented ischemia-reperfusion injury as shown by reduced levels of serum creatinine or blood urea nitrogen compared to control mice. Further studies indicated that fewer CD4-cells infiltrated the post-ischemic kidneys of IL-16-deficient mice and that the protective effect of IL-16 antibody treatment was lymphocyte-dependent. Our results suggest that IL-16 is a critical factor in the development of inflammation-mediated renal injury and may be a therapeutic target for prevention of ischemia-reperfusion injury of the kidney.
18004559	X-ray absorption and diffraction studies of the metal binding sites in amyloid beta-peptide.	A major source of neurodegeneration observed in Alzheimer's disease is believed to be caused by the toxicity from reactive oxygen species produced in the brain mediated by the A beta protein and mainly copper species. An atomic model of an amyloid beta-peptide (A beta) Cu2+ complex or at least the structure of the metal binding site is of great interest. Accurate information about the Cu-binding site of A beta protein can facilitate simulation of redox chemistry using high level quantum mechanics. Complementary X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption techniques can be employed to obtain such accurate information. This review provides a blend of X-ray diffraction results on amyloid structures and selected works on A beta Cu2+ binding based on spectroscopic measurements with emphasis on the X-ray absorption technique.
18004570	In vitro evaluation of the growth inhibition and apoptosis effect of mifepristone (RU486) in human Ishikawa and HEC1A endometrial cancer cell lines.	PURPOSE: To determine the growth inhibitory effects of mifepristone on endometrial cancer cell growth and evaluate its effect on apoptosis using HEC-1-A and Ishikawa human endometrial cancer cell lines. METHODS: The human endometrial cancer cell lines, HEC-1-A and Ishikawa, were cultured in vitro. MTT assays were completed in order to estimate the IC(50) of mifepristone. Both cell lines were then treated with the respective IC(50) values. Immunohistochemistry assays were performed to investigate the expression of estrogen receptors alpha and beta (ERalpha/beta), progesterone receptor alpha and beta (PR alpha/beta), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), bax, p53, and bcl-2. Flow cytometry analysis was performed to study cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. RESULTS: The estimated IC(50) of mifepristone for HEC-1-A and Ishikawa was found to be 16 and 19 mug/ml respectively. At this concentration, there was no change in either ERalpha/beta or PR alpha/beta in Ishikawa. However, PR beta expression increased with time of treatment in HEC-1-A. Expression of p53 was increased with duration of treatment in both cell lines. Consequently a decrease in bcl-2 and an increase in COX-2 expression were seen in HEC-1-A and Ishikawa cells, respectively. Lastly, flow cytometry analysis confirmed an accumulation of cells in G0 phase after 72 h of treatment in both cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: Mifepristone demonstrates activity in both HEC-1-A and Ishikawa cells at clinically relevant concentrations based on an oral human dose of about 200 mg/day. While its mechanism of action remains unknown, this data supports an increase in apoptosis that may be due to p53 activation rather than hormone receptor mediation. Additional studies are needed to help further identify mifepristone mechanism of action.
18004726	Neuroendocrine differentiation in the 12T-10 transgenic prostate mouse model mimics endocrine differentiation of pancreatic beta cells.	BACKGROUND: Neuroendocrine (NE) prostate cancer develops as an aggressive disease that does not respond to androgen ablation therapy. It has been demonstrated that the paracrine action of NE cells facilitates the progression of androgen dependent adenocarcinoma to an androgen independent state, suggesting a significant role for NE cells during failure of androgen ablation therapy. METHODS: To investigate the pathways that are involved in NE differentiation of prostate cancer, we have looked at the expression of genes known to be involved in endocrine differentiation of beta-cells in the pancreas. This study has been performed using the NE prostate cancer mouse model (12T-10) and the derivative allograft model (NE-10). RESULTS: Immunohistochemical studies have shown that the neuroendocrine prostate tumors express the transcription factors Foxa2, mouse achaete-scute homolog-1 (mash-1), neurogenin3 (Ngn3) and Nkx2.2. These tumors show a loss of hairy/enhancer of split (Hes-1), a gene that inhibits NE differentiation. Human NE prostate cancers also express Foxa2 and human achaete-scute homolog-1 (HASH-1). These genes are expressed in NE prostate tumors in the similar sequential manner as they appear in a pancreatic beta-cell endocrine differentiation. Foxa2 expression is detected in early prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN). Mash-1 expression is detected in a few clusters within low grade PIN lesions and Nkx2.2 expression is rarely detected in individual scattered cells within the PIN lesion. Ngn3 and Nkx2.2 frequently appear in the invasive NE cancer. Subsequent NE metastasis to lung and liver show a distinct gene expression pattern. The lung metastasis expresses Ngn3 but does not express Nkx2.2 whereas liver metastases do not express Ngn3 but express Nkx2.2. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that Ngn3 and Nkx2.2 expression are markers for site-specific metastasis and/or transcriptionally regulated genes that are required for organ-specific metastasis. This study indicates that a pathway similar to pancreatic beta-cell differentiation is involved in NE differentiation of prostate cancer.
18004750	Crystal structure of a secondary vitamin D3 binding site of milk beta-lactoglobulin.	Beta-lactoglobulin (beta-LG), one of the most investigated proteins, is a major bovine milk protein with a predominantly beta structure. The structural function of the only alpha-helix with three turns at the C-terminus is unknown. Vitamin D(3) binds to the central calyx formed by the beta-strands. Whether there are two vitamin D binding-sites in each beta-LG molecule has been a subject of controversy. Here, we report a second vitamin D(3) binding site identified by synchrotron X-ray diffraction (at 2.4 A resolution). In the central calyx binding mode, the aliphatic tail of vitamin D(3) clearly inserts into the binding cavity, where the 3-OH group of vitamin D(3) binds externally. The electron density map suggests that the 3-OH group interacts with the carbonyl of Lys-60 forming a hydrogen bond (2.97 A). The second binding site, however, is near the surface at the C-terminus (residues 136-149) containing part of an alpha-helix and a beta-strand I with 17.91 A in length, while the span of vitamin D(3) is about 12.51 A. A remarkable feature of the second exosite is that it combines an amphipathic alpha-helix providing nonpolar residues (Phe-136, Ala-139, and Leu-140) and a beta-strand providing a nonpolar (Ile-147) and a buried polar residue (Arg-148). They are linked by a hydrophobic loop (Ala-142, Leu-143, Pro-144, and Met-145). Thus, the binding pocket furnishes strong hydrophobic force to stabilize vitamin D(3) binding. This finding provides a new insight into the interaction between vitamin D(3) and beta-LG, in which the exosite may provide another route for the transport of vitamin D(3) in vitamin D(3) fortified dairy products. Atomic coordinates for the crystal structure of beta-LG-vitamin D(3) complex described in this work have been deposited in the PDB (access code 2GJ5).
18004760	Evaluating the potency of HIV-1 protease drugs to combat resistance.	HIV-1 protease has been an important drug target for the antiretroviral treatment of HIV infection. The efficacy of protease drugs is impaired by the rapid emergence of resistant virus strains. Understanding the molecular basis and evaluating the potency of an inhibitor to combat resistance are no doubt important in AIDS therapy. In this study, we first identified residues that have significant contributions to binding with six substrates using molecular dynamics simulations and Molecular Mechanics Generalized Born Surface Area calculations. Among the critical residues, Asp25, Gly27, Ala28, Asp29, and Gly49 are well conserved, with which the potent drugs should form strong interactions. We then calculated the contribution of each residue to binding with eight FDA approved drugs. We analyzed the conservation of each protease residue and also compared the interaction between the HIV protease and individual residues of the drugs and substrates. Our analyses showed that resistant mutations usually occur at less conserved residues forming more favorable interactions with drugs than with substrates. To quantitatively integrate the binding free energy and conservation information, we defined an empirical parameter called free energy/variability (FV) value, which is the product of the contribution of a single residue to the binding free energy and the sequence variability at that position. As a validation, the FV value was shown to identify single resistant mutations with an accuracy of 88%. Finally, we evaluated the potency of a newly approved drug, darunavir, to combat resistance and predicted that darunavir is more potent than amprenavir but may be susceptible to mutations on Val32 and Ile84.
18004784	Protein structure mining using a structural alphabet.	We present a comprehensive evaluation of a new structure mining method called PB-ALIGN. It is based on the encoding of protein structure as 1D sequence of a combination of 16 short structural motifs or protein blocks (PBs). PBs are short motifs capable of representing most of the local structural features of a protein backbone. Using derived PB substitution matrix and simple dynamic programming algorithm, PB sequences are aligned the same way amino acid sequences to yield structure alignment. PBs are short motifs capable of representing most of the local structural features of a protein backbone. Alignment of these local features as sequence of symbols enables fast detection of structural similarities between two proteins. Ability of the method to characterize and align regions beyond regular secondary structures, for example, N and C caps of helix and loops connecting regular structures, puts it a step ahead of existing methods, which strongly rely on secondary structure elements. PB-ALIGN achieved efficiency of 85% in extracting true fold from a large database of 7259 SCOP domains and was successful in 82% cases to identify true super-family members. On comparison to 13 existing structure comparison/mining methods, PB-ALIGN emerged as the best on general ability test dataset and was at par with methods like YAKUSA and CE on nontrivial test dataset. Furthermore, the proposed method performed well when compared to flexible structure alignment method like FATCAT and outperforms in processing speed (less than 45 s per database scan). This work also establishes a reliable cut-off value for the demarcation of similar folds. It finally shows that global alignment scores of unrelated structures using PBs follow an extreme value distribution. PB-ALIGN is freely available on web server called Protein Block Expert (PBE) at http://bioinformatics.univ-reunion.fr/PBE/.
18004950	Integrated contextual representation for objects' identities and their locations.	Visual context plays a prominent role in everyday perception. Contextual information can facilitate recognition of objects within scenes by providing predictions about objects that are most likely to appear in a specific setting, along with the locations that are most likely to contain objects in the scene. Is such identity-related ("semantic") and location-related ("spatial") contextual knowledge represented separately or jointly as a bound representation? We conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) priming experiment whereby semantic and spatial contextual relations between prime and target object pictures were independently manipulated. This method allowed us to determine whether the two contextual factors affect object recognition with or without interacting, supporting a unified versus independent representations, respectively. Results revealed a Semantic x Spatial interaction in reaction times for target object recognition. Namely, significant semantic priming was obtained when targets were positioned in expected (congruent), but not in unexpected (incongruent), locations. fMRI results showed corresponding interactive effects in brain regions associated with semantic processing (inferior prefrontal cortex), visual contextual processing (parahippocampal cortex), and object-related processing (lateral occipital complex). In addition, activation in fronto-parietal areas suggests that attention and memory-related processes might also contribute to the contextual effects observed. These findings indicate that object recognition benefits from associative representations that integrate information about objects' identities and their locations, and directly modulate activation in object-processing cortical regions. Such context frames are useful in maintaining a coherent and meaningful representation of the visual world, and in providing a platform from which predictions can be generated to facilitate perception and action.
18005126	A review of children's decision-making competence in health care.	AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this literature review was to search for and review, systematically, children's decision-making competence in health care in the scientific literature. Findings of both quantitative and qualitative studies were analysed thematically. BACKGROUND: Most previous research in children's decision-making competence in health care concerns adults' care in the best interests of the child. It is important to consider decision-making competence from the child's perspective because of children's own human rights. METHODS: Systematic review including database search, manual selection, supplementary searching, management and acquisition of relevant literature, quality appraisal, literature review saturation and thematic review. RESULTS: Six themes emerged: measurable issues, values and beliefs, power, parent-related communication, trust and self-determination. Measurable issues were age, reading ability and memory. Values and beliefs as well as power and parent-related communication were associated with healthcare professionals. Children showed trust and expressed a wish to use self-determination. CONCLUSIONS: Age appropriate information and participation were prerequisites for allowing children to have possibilities of making competent decisions about their own care. Children's decision-making competence is dependent on others, such as parents and healthcare professionals, attitudes and not only on their own capacity. Lack of competence, however, does not exclude children from the human right to have a say. It should be noted that it is a decision to leave the determination to a parent or healthcare professional. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Future research from the viewpoint of children is important to reach optimal levels of participation, through respecting their integrity and to develop them into potential competent decision makers.
18005140	Percutaneous balloon compression for trigeminal neuralgias and autonomic cephalalgia.	OBJECTIVE: This prospective study aimed to evaluate the results of percutaneous trigeminal ganglion balloon compression (BC) in patients with various types of trigeminal neuralgia (TN) and autonomic cephalalgia. METHODS: Twenty-five consecutive patients underwent BC and were followed up for 27-60 months. They were divided into 2 groups: group A (n=18) patients with idiopathic TN and group B (n=7) patients with secondary TN (n=5) and trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia (TAC) (n=2). RESULTS: Postoperatively, 15 patients in group A experienced pain relief, one required medication and 2 had no response; in group B, 6 were free of pain, including the 2 patients with TAC, and one required medication. Complications in both groups were either functionally trivial or infrequent. None of the patients developed keratitis or anesthesia dolorosa. Pain recurrence occurred early (<6 months) in one patient from group B, and late in 2 patients from group A. CONCLUSION: Balloon compression is a minimally invasive procedure that seems to be comparably successful for idiopathic and secondary TN, as well as TAC. However, further studies are deemed necessary to establish it as the first-line treatment in medically resistant trigeminal pain.
18005181	Array-based genotype-phenotype correlation in a case of supernumerary ring chromosome 12.	Supernumerary ring chromosomes (SRC) account for approximately 10% of prenatal marker chromosomes and 60% of these SRCs are associated with an abnormal phenotype of the patient carrying them. SRCs have, with few exceptions, not been characterized at the molecular genetic level. Here, we present the first case of a SRC 12 thoroughly investigated with tiling resolution array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH); multicolor, centromere, subtelomeric and whole chromosome painting fluorescence in situ hybridization. In addition, to be able to correlate phenotypic manifestations with a possible pathogenetic outcome of the SRC 12, we retrospectively compared and reviewed all 14 cases of SRC 12 reported, including our present case. Our analyses revealed that the SRC comprised 25.53-46.40 Mb of chromosome 12, a region known to harbor 47 annotated genes of which nine were of putative pathogenetic relevance. Reviewing the previously described cases of SRC 12, we could not establish any specific recurrent features associated with this type of SRC. This most probably reflects heterogeneity in break-point distribution among the reported cases, resulting in differently sized ring chromosomes and hence varying phenotypic traits of the patients. Detailed genomic evaluation, by array CGH or similar techniques may thus be of importance to predict the clinical course in individual cases.
18005224	Expression of transglutaminase 2 does not differentiate focal myositis from generalized inflammatory myopathies.	OBJECTIVES: Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM), including dermatomyositis (DM), polymyositis (PM), sporadic inclusion-body myositis (s-IBM) and focal myositis (FM) are a heterogeneous group of autoimmune disorders of skeletal muscle. An increased transglutaminase 2 (TG2) expression has been found in DM, PM and s-IBM. The aim of our study was to investigate TG2 expression in FM in comparison with other IIM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We re-examined tissue material we have gathered in the course of our previous studies on IIM, investigating muscle expression of TG2 in patients with FM in comparison with DM, PM and s-IBM using immunocytochemistry and real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: Immunocytochemistry revealed an increased TG2 signal in endomysial vessels, in atrophic and degenerating/regenerating muscle fibres in PM, DM, s-IBM and FM; in s-IBM, some vacuoles were immunostained too. Real-time RT-PCR study confirmed a significantly increased expression of TG2 in all IIM muscles examined. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates the presence of TG2 in FM muscles. The study suggests that TG2 expression does not represent a distinctive marker to differentiate FM from generalized IIM. TG2 over-expression in inflamed skeletal muscle does not seem have a pathogenetic role in such a disease, but it could represent a way to contain the inflammatory process.
18005348	Germination and outgrowth of Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus licheniformis spores in the gastrointestinal tract of pigs.	AIMS: To determine if orally ingested Bacillus spores used as probiotics or direct-fed microbial feed additives germinate and the vegetative cells grow in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. METHODS AND RESULTS: Three independent experiments were done to determine if spores of Bacillus licheniformis and Bacillus subtilis germinate and grow in the GI tract of pigs. After a 2 weeks spore-feeding period, spores were detected in all segments of the GI tract. The lowest number of spores was found in the stomach, increasing in the small intestine to approx. 55% of the dietary inclusion. When spores were withdrawn from the feed, faecal excretion of spores reflected the dietary inclusion, but decreased gradually to the background level after 1 week. By containing spores in short, sealed pieces of dialysis membrane that were orally administered to the pigs, both the number of spores and vegetative cells could be determined by flow cytometry. Spores accounted for 72% of the total counts after 4-6 h in the stomach and proximal part of the small intestine. After 24 h, spores constituted only 12% of the total counts in the stomach, caecum, and mid-colon. Less spores and more vegetative cells were detected after 24 h, but total counts increased only 2.14-fold compared to time zero. CONCLUSIONS: The experiments showed that 70-90% of dietary-supplemented Bacillus spores germinate in the proximal part of the pig GI tract, and that only limited outgrowth of the vegetative cell population occurs. The two Bacillus strains can temporarily remain in the GI system, but will be unable to permanently colonize the GI tract. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: A substantial population of growing vegetative cells in the GI tract is not a prerequisite for the mode of action of Bacillus feed additives and probiotics.
18005359	Dyskeratosis congenita: a genetic disorder of many faces.	Dyskeratosis congenita (DC) is an inherited syndrome exhibiting marked clinical and genetic heterogeneity. It is characterized by multiple features including mucocutaneous abnormalities, bone marrow failure and an increased predisposition to cancer. Three genetic subtypes are recognized: X-linked recessive DC bears mutations in DKC1, the gene encoding dyskerin, a component of H/ACA small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein particles; autosomal dominant (AD) DC has heterozygous mutations in either TERC or TERT, the RNA and enzymatic components of telomerase, respectively, and autosomal recessive DC in which the genes involved remain largely elusive. Disease pathology is believed to be a consequence of chromosome instability because of telomerase deficiency due to mutations in DKC1, TERC and TERT; in patients with DKC1 mutations, defects in ribosomal RNA modification, ribosome biogenesis, translation control or mRNA splicing may also contribute to disease pathogenesis. The involvement of telomerase complex components in X-linked and AD forms and the presence of short telomeres in DC patients suggest that DC is primarily a disease of defective telomere maintenance. Treatment is variable and complicated by the development of secondary cancers but, being a monogenic disorder, it could potentially be treated by gene therapy. DC overlaps both clinically and genetically with several other diseases including Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome, aplastic anaemia and myelodysplasia, among others and its underlying telomeric defect has implications for a broader range of biological processes including ageing and many forms of cancer.
18005949	Cell wall carbohydrates from fruit pulp of Argania spinosa: structural analysis of pectin and xyloglucan polysaccharides.	Isolated cell walls of Argania spinosa fruit pulp were fractionated into their polysaccharide constituents and the resulting fractions were analysed for monosaccharide composition and chemical structure. The data reveal the presence of homogalacturonan, rhamnogalacturonan-I (RG-I) and rhamnogalacturonan-II (RG-II) in the pectic fraction. RG-I is abundant and contains high amounts of Ara and Gal, indicative of an important branching in this polysaccharide. RG-II is less abundant than RG-I and exists as a dimer. Structural characterisation of xyloglucan using enzymatic hydrolysis, gas chromatography, MALDI-TOF-MS and methylation analysis shows that XXGG, XXXG, XXLG and XLLG are the major subunit oligosaccharides in the ratio of 0.6:1:1.2:1.6. This finding demonstrates that the major neutral hemicellulosic polysaccharide is a galacto-xyloglucan. In addition, Argania fruit xyloglucan has no XUFG, a novel xyloglucan motif recently discovered in Argania leaf cell walls. Finally, the isolation and analysis of arabinogalactan-proteins showed that Argania fruit pulp is rich in these proteoglycans.
18005983	Protein-DNA interactions that govern AAA+ activator-dependent bacterial transcription initiation.	Transcriptional control at the promoter melting step is not yet well understood. In this study, a site-directed photo-cross-linking method was used to systematically analyse component protein-DNA interactions that govern promoter melting by the enhancer-dependent Escherichia coli RNA polymerase (RNAP) containing the sigma(54) promoter specificity factor (E sigma(54)) at a single base pair resolution in three functional states. The sigma(54)-factor imposes tight control upon the RNAP by creating a regulatory switch where promoter melting nucleates, approximately 12 bp upstream of the transcription start site. Promoter melting by E sigma(54) is only triggered upon remodelling of this regulatory switch by a specialised activator protein in an ATP-hydrolysing reaction. We demonstrate that prior to DNA melting, only the sigma(54)-factor directly interacts with the promoter in the regulatory switch within the initial closed E sigma(54)-promoter complex and one intermediate E sigma(54)-promoter complex. We establish that activator-induced conformational rearrangements in the regulatory switch are a prerequisite to allow the promoter to enter the catalytic cleft of the RNAP and hence establish the transcriptionally competent open complex, where full promoter melting occurs. These results significantly advance our current understanding of the structural transitions occurring at bacterial promoters, where regulation occurs at the DNA melting step.
18005988	Structural analysis of the human galectin-9 N-terminal carbohydrate recognition domain reveals unexpected properties that differ from the mouse orthologue.	Galectins are a family of beta-galactoside-binding lectins that contain a conserved carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD). They exhibit high affinities for small beta-galactosides as well as variable binding specificities for complex glycoconjugates. Structural and biochemical analyses of the mechanism governing specific carbohydrate recognition provide a useful template to elucidate the function of these proteins. Here we report the crystal structures of the human galectin-9 N-terminal CRD (NCRD) in the presence of lactose and Forssman pentasaccharide. Mouse galectin-9 NCRD, the structure of which was previously solved by our group, forms a non-canonical dimer in both the crystal state and in solution. Human galectin-9 NCRD, however, exists as a monomer in crystals, despite a high sequence identity to the mouse homologue. Comparative frontal affinity chromatography analysis of the mouse and human galectin-9 NCRDs revealed different carbohydrate binding specificities, with disparate affinities for complex glycoconjugates. Human galectin-9 NCRD exhibited a high affinity for Forssman pentasaccharide; the association constant for mouse galectin-9 NCRD was 100-fold less than that observed for the human protein. The combination of structural data with mutational studies demonstrated that non-conserved amino acid residues on the concave surface were important for determination of target specificities. The human galectin-9 NCRD exhibited greater inhibition of cell proliferation than the mouse NCRD. We discuss the biochemical and structural differences between highly homologous proteins from different species.
18006108	Controlled differentiation of stem cells.	The extracellular microenvironment plays a significant role in controlling cellular behavior. Identification of appropriate biomaterials that support cellular attachment, proliferation and, most importantly in the case of human embryonic stem cells, lineage-specific differentiation is critical for tissue engineering and cellular therapy. In addition to growth factors and morphogenetic factors known to induce lineage commitment of stem cells, a number of scaffolding materials, including synthetic and naturally-derived biomaterials, have been utilized in tissue engineering approaches to direct differentiation. This review focuses on recent emerging findings and well-characterized differentiation models of human embryonic stem cells. Additionally, we also discuss about various strategies that have been used in stem cell expansion.
18006274	Identification and characterization of novel mouse PDE4D isoforms: molecular cloning, subcellular distribution and detection of isoform-specific intracellular localization signals.	We report here the cloning and characterization of short and supershort mouse PDE4D isoforms. PDE4D is one of the phosphodiesterase enzyme families with multiple promoters and splice variants. PDE4 isoforms present in humans, rats and mice share considerable homology in their catalytic and regulatory domains. In this study, we have identified the novel PDE4D2 variant3 (PDE4D2v3) and PDE4D10 isoforms and the mouse orthologs of PDE4D1, PDE4D2 variant1 (PDE4D2v1), PDE4D2 variant2 (PDE4D2v2) and PDE4D6 isoforms. These isoforms have many different lengths of 5'UTR, signifying the use of different transcription start sites. Our data indicate that many novel PDE4D isoforms exist as a result of alternative mRNA splicing, each isoform having unique N-terminal regions and multiple transcription start sites. Subcellular distribution study showed that the PDE4D1 short isoforms are localized to the nucleus while the supershort isoforms (PDE4D2v1, PDE4D2v2, PDE4D2v3, PDE4D6 and PDE4D10) are restricted to the cytoplasm. Deletion study confirmed that the N-terminus of PDE4D1 is necessary for nuclear targeting. In addition, we showed that the unique N-terminus contains nuclear localization signal sequence. Identifying novel tissue-specific PDE4D isoforms with unique N-terminal regions may aid in the development of selective phosphodiesterase inhibitors.
18006289	An integrated algorithm for gene selection and classification applied to microarray data of ovarian cancer.	OBJECTIVE: The type of data in microarray provides unprecedented amount of data. A typical microarray data of ovarian cancer consists of the expressions of tens of thousands of genes on a genomic scale, and there is no systematic procedure to analyze this information instantaneously. To avoid higher computational complexity, it needs to select the most likely differentially expressed gene markers to explain the effects of ovarian cancer. Traditionally, gene markers are selected by ranking genes according to statistics or machine learning algorithms. In this paper, an integrated algorithm is derived for gene selection and classification in microarray data of ovarian cancer. METHODS: First, regression analysis is applied to find target genes. Genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), support vector machine (SVM), and analysis of variance (ANOVA) are hybridized to select gene markers from target genes. Finally, the improved fuzzy model is applied to classify cancer tissues. RESULTS: The microarray data of ovarian cancer, obtained from China Medical University Hospital, is used to test the performance of the proposed algorithm. In simulation, 200 target genes are obtained after regression analysis and six gene markers are selected from the hybrid process of GA, PCO, SVM and ANOVA. Additionally, these gene markers are used to classify cancer tissues. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed algorithm can be used to analyze gene expressions and has superior performance in microarray data of ovarian cancer, and it can be performed on other studies for cancer diagnosis.
18006328	Targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor in metastatic colorectal cancer.	Although significant advances have been made in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC), prognosis remains poor, with a 5-year survival of less than 10%. Monoclonal antibodies that target the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have shown clinical benefit as single agents and in combination with standard chemotherapy in the refractory setting, with tolerable toxicity. This article will discuss the role of the EGFR pathway in the pathogenesis of CRC, the data supporting the current use of cetuximab and panitumumab in the treatment of CRC, and clinical trials of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors in CRC. Novel strategies of targeting the EGFR pathway to improve efficacy, as well as ongoing research in identifying molecular predictors of response to anti-EGFR agents, will also be reviewed.
18006385	First phenotypic description of Fasciola hepatica/Fasciola gigantica intermediate forms from the human endemic area of the Nile Delta, Egypt.	Fasciola gigantica is the main fasciolid species in Africa; however, F. hepatica and F. gigantica overlap in some countries. Egypt deserves mentioning because of the emerging situation of human fascioliasis in the Nile Delta area. The morphometric characteristics of fasciolid adults infecting the main livestock species present in the Nile Delta human endemic area are analyzed through a computer image analysis system (CIAS) on the basis of standardized measurements known to be useful for the differentiation of both fasciolid species. This is the first time that such a study is performed in an African country and, therefore, the results are compared to (i) F. hepatica (European Mediterranean area) and F. gigantica (Burkina Faso) standard populations, i.e. geographical areas where both species do not co-exist, and (ii) F. hepatica and F. gigantica populations from geographical areas where both species do co-exist, including the presence of intermediate forms (Iran). Results indicate the presence of F. hepatica, F. gigantica and intermediate forms (Fasciola sp.) in Egypt for the first time, and demonstrate the usefulness of CIAS for the phenotypic characterization of liver fluke adults from a concrete fascioliasis endemic area. Body roundness, body length over body width, and distance between the ventral sucker and the posterior end of the body provide useful tools for studying inter- and intraspecific morphological diversity in Fasciola adults. The application of these markers to specimens from geographical areas where F. hepatica and F. gigantica co-exist, such as in Egypt and Iran, suggest a strong population-level variation in Fasciola adult morphology.
18006432	Activation of fractalkine/CX3CR1 by vascular endothelial cells induces angiogenesis through VEGF-A/KDR and reverses hindlimb ischaemia.	AIMS: The present study investigated the detailed mechanism by which fractalkine (Fkn), a CX3C chemokine, induces angiogenesis and its functional implication in alleviating ischaemia in vivo. METHODS AND RESULTS: Fkn induced new vessel formation on the excised rat aorta and chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) through CX3CR1 activation. Immunoblotting analysis, promoter assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that Fkn upregulated hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1alpha) by cultured human aortic endothelial cells (ECs), which in turn induced mRNA and protein levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A through a p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. In vivo Fkn-induced angiogenesis on CAM was completely blocked by functional inhibition of VEGF receptor 2 kinase insert domain-containing receptor (KDR) and Rho GTPase. C57/BL6 mice with CX3CR1(-/-) bone marrow-derived cells developed angiogenesis in the implanted Fkn-mixed Matrigel plug, suggesting CX3CR1 activation in vascular ECs is sufficient for Fkn-induced angiogenesis in vivo. The condition of rat hindlimb ischaemia, which rapidly stimulated mRNA expression of both Fkn and VEGF-A, was significantly alleviated by the injection of whole-length Fkn protein. CONCLUSION: Fkn-induced activation of CX3CR1 by ECs leads to in vivo angiogenesis through two sequential steps: the induction of HIF-1alpha and VEGF-A gene expression by CX3CR1 activation and the subsequent VEGF-A/KDR-induced angiogenesis. The potent induction of angiogenesis by Fkn can be used as a therapeutic strategy for alleviating peripheral ischaemia.
18006540	Serum IgG antibodies to peptidylarginine deiminase 4 in rheumatoid arthritis and associations with disease severity.	BACKGROUND: Antibodies targeting citrullinated antigens are specific for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Citrullination is catalysed by the peptidylarginine deiminase (PAD) enzyme family. Critical enzymes are often targeted by disease-specific antibodies in complex immune-mediated diseases. Here, we have tested for autoantibodies against human recombinant PAD4 (hPAD4) in Caucasian RA patients. METHODS: A time-resolved fluorometric immunoassay based on hPAD4 was developed to analyse sera from two RA cohorts (n = 237 and n = 177), one systemic lupus erythaematosus (SLE) cohort (n = 84) and 148 healthy controls. Simple and multiple analyses were performed to examine possible associations between anti-hPAD4 and disease variables. RESULTS: Raised levels of anti-hPAD4 IgG were found in both RA cohorts compared to the controls, and 23% of the RA patients were anti-hPAD4 IgG positive. Anti-hPAD4 was associated with anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) and rheumatoid factor (RF), as well as increased physical disability. Anti-hPAD4 was also associated with higher longitudinal radiographic damage scores and increased clinical joint pathology, but weaker than anti-CCP. No associations were found between anti-hPAD4 and selected Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DRB1 variants. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 23% of Caucasian RA patients have serum IgG antibodies against hPAD4. The presence of serum anti-hPAD4 IgG was in simple analyses associated with a more severe disease phenotype, and the association with physical disability was maintained in multiple analyses.
18006562	Trends in pneumonia and empyema in Scottish children in the past 25 years.	BACKGROUND: The incidence of childhood empyema, a complication of pneumonia, is increasing, and the underlying mechanisms are not understood. Whether a rise in pneumonia incidence could account for the increase in empyema remains to be seen. OBJECTIVE: To report trends for empyema admissions in the context of pneumonia and croup admissions in Scottish children over a 25-year period to 2005. DESIGN: Whole-population study with retrospective analysis using diagnosis codes (International classification of diseases, 9th and 10th revisions). SETTING: All non-obstetric and non-psychiatric hospitals in Scotland. PARTICIPANTS: Patients <15 years admitted with a diagnosis of empyema, pneumonia or croup (the latter included for reference) between 1 January 1981 and 31 December 2005. RESULTS: There were 217 admissions for empyema in children (76 1-4-year olds), 24,312 admissions for pneumonia (11,299 1-4-year olds), and 31 120 (20,332 1-4-year olds) for croup. Empyema admissions increased after 1998 from <10 per million children per annum to reach a peak of 37 per million in 2005. In the 1-4-year age group, empyema admissions rose in the late 1990s and 2000s from an average of 6.5 per million per year between 1981 and 1998 to 66 per million in 2005. Overall annual admission rates for pneumonia remained unchanged in most age groups. However, among 1-4-year olds, admissions rose steadily by an average of 50 per million per year between 1981 and 2005. Admission rates for croup in Scottish children (<15 years) remained stable over the preceding 25 years. CONCLUSIONS: This whole-population study shows that the incidence of childhood empyema has risen since 1998 and continues to rise independently of pneumonia. Croup admissions remained stable, suggesting that changes in coding or admission policies are not likely to explain the observed trends. The observations suggest that the rise in empyema is not related to an increase in pneumonia. Changes in bacterial pathogenicity and/or host susceptibility may be important.
18006579	Natriuretic peptide C receptor signalling in the heart and vasculature.	Natriuretic peptides (NPs), including atrial, brain and C-type natriuretic peptides (ANP, BNP and CNP), bind two classes of cell surface receptors: the guanylyl cyclase-linked A and B receptors (NPR-A and NPR-B) and the C receptor (NPR-C). The biological effects of NPs have been mainly attributed to changes in intracellular cGMP following their binding to NPR-A and NPR-B. NPR-C does not include a guanylyl cyclase domain. It has been denoted as a clearance receptor and is thought to bind and internalize NPs for ultimate degradation. However, a substantial body of biochemical work has demonstrated the ability of NPR-C to couple to inhibitory G proteins (Gi) and cause inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and activation of phospholipase-C. Recently, novel physiological effects of NPs, mediated specifically by NPR-C, have been discovered in the heart and vasculature. We have described the ability of CNP, acting via NPR-C, to selectively inhibit L-type calcium currents in atrial and ventricular myocytes, as well as in pacemaker cells (sinoatrial node myocytes). In contrast, our studies of the electrophysiological effects of CNP on cardiac fibroblasts demonstrated an NPR-C-Gi-phospholipase-C-dependent activation of a non-selective cation current mediated by transient receptor potential (TRP) channels. It is also known that CNP and BNP have important anti-proliferative effects in cardiac fibroblasts that appear to involve NPR-C. In the mammalian resistance vessels, including mesenteric and coronary arteries, CNP has been found to function as an NPR-C-dependent endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor that regulates local blood flow and systemic blood pressure by hyperpolarizing smooth muscle cells. In this review we highlight the role of NPR-C in mediating these NP effects in myocytes and fibroblasts from the heart as well as in vascular smooth muscle cells.
18008161	Adherence to exercise training in heart failure: a review.	Exercise training is increasingly recognized as a viable treatment option for patients with heart failure (HF). For exercise to be a maximally effective treatment, it is important that patients adhere to the exercise prescription. In this review, the current state of adherence monitoring and intervention in randomized HF trials will be summarized, along with recommendations for advancing understanding of adherence in this population. Barriers to exercise participation and strategies to enhance adherence to exercise-training programs will be explored. Finally, directions for future research on exercise adherence in HF patients will be provided.
18020406	Interactive three-dimensional visualization and contextual analysis of protein interaction networks.	To understand the biology of the interactome, the covisualization of protein interactions and other protein-related data is required. In this study, we have adapted a 3-D network visualization platform, GEOMI, to allow the coanalysis of protein-protein interaction networks with proteomic parameters such as protein localization, abundance, physicochemical parameters, post-translational modifications, and gene ontology classification. Working with Saccharomyces cerevisiae data, we show that rich and interactive visualizations, constructed from multidimensional orthogonal data, provide insights on the complexity of the interactome and its role in biological processes and the architecture of the cell. We present the first organelle-specific interaction networks, that provide subinteractomes of high biological interest. We further present some of the first views of the interactome built from a new combination of yeast two-hybrid data and stable protein complexes, which are likely to approximate the true workings of stable and transient aspects of the interactome. The GEOMI tool and all interactome data are freely available by contacting the authors.
18021033	Hispanic female adolescents' use of illicit drugs and the risk of suicidal thoughts.	OBJECTIVES: To examine the association between female adolescents in high school who use illicit drugs and seriously consider attempting suicide. METHODS: Data were analyzed from the 2003 Youth Risk Behavioral Surveillance System. Variables for suicidal thought, illicit drugs, and covariables were chosen to explore the association. RESULTS: Seriously considering attempting suicide was associated with Hispanics, suburban youth, use of marijuana, inhalants, methamphetamines, and steroids without MD's prescription. CONCLUSIONS: Greater effort may be necessary to raise awareness about the physical and mental health status of Hispanic adolescents and to ensure good mental health programs are available.
18021245	Evolution of virulence: triggering host inflammation allows invading pathogens to exclude competitors.	Virulence is generally considered to benefit parasites by enhancing resource-transfer from host to pathogen. Here, we offer an alternative framework where virulent immune-provoking behaviours and enhanced immune resistance are joint tactics of invading pathogens to eliminate resident competitors (transferring resources from resident to invading pathogen). The pathogen wins by creating a novel immunological challenge to which it is already adapted. We analyse a general ecological model of 'proactive invasion' where invaders not adapted to a local environment can succeed by changing it to one where they are better adapted than residents. However, the two-trait nature of the 'proactive' strategy (provocation of, and adaptation to environmental change) presents an evolutionary conundrum, as neither trait alone is favoured in a homogenous host population. We show that this conundrum can be resolved by allowing for host heterogeneity. We relate our model to emerging empirical findings on immunological mediation of parasite competition.
18021293	MAPK and mTOR pathways are involved in cadmium-induced neuronal apoptosis.	Cadmium (Cd) may be accumulated in human body through long-term exposure to Cd-polluted environment, resulting in neurodegeneration and other diseases. To study the mechanism of Cd-induced neurodegeneration, PC12 and SH-SY5Y cells were exposed to Cd. We observed that Cd-induced apoptosis in the cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Cd rapidly activated the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) including extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38. Inhibition of Erk1/2 and JNK, but not p38, partially protected the cells from Cd-induced apoptosis. Consistently, over-expression of dominant negative c-Jun or down-regulation of Erk1/2, but not p38 MAPK, partially prevented Cd-induced apoptosis. To our surprise, Cd also activated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-mediated signaling pathways. Treatment with rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, blocked Cd-induced phosphorylation of S6K1 and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding protein 1, and markedly inhibited Cd-induced apoptosis. Down-regulation of mTOR by RNA interference also in part, rescued cells from Cd-induced death. These findings indicate that activation of the signaling network of MAPK and mTOR is associated with Cd-induced neuronal apoptosis. Our results strongly suggest that inhibitors of MAPK and mTOR may have a potential for prevention of Cd-induced neurodegeneration.
18022237	Protein phosphatase subunit G5PR that regulates the JNK-mediated apoptosis signal is essential for the survival of CD4 and CD8 double-positive thymocytes.	Early T lineage cells are selected in the thymus by the specific recognition of peptide components presented by MHC molecules on the surface of thymic epithelial cells and dendritic cells. As a potential regulator of the apoptotic and survival signals, the protein phosphatase 2A-component G5PR regulates Bim phosphorylation in B-cells. Here, we studied whether G5PR is involved in the regulation of the similar apoptotic pathway for cell survival during the selection of thymocytes. T-cell-specific G5PR knockout (G5pr(-/-)) mice displayed thymic atrophy, significant reduction in thymocyte numbers, particularly a 10-fold decrease in the number of CD4 and CD8 double-positive (DP) thymocytes and few mature single-positive (SP) cells. G5pr(-/-) thymocytes exhibited normal potential of proliferation and differentiation during the transition from double-negative (DN) to DP stage, but significantly increased susceptibility to apoptosis at the DP stage. G5PR deficiency did not affect on Bim activation in thymocytes, but caused hyper-activation of JNK and Caspase-3 with augmented Fas ligand (FasL) expression, indicating that G5PR regulates the thymocyte unique apoptotic signal involved in JNK-mediated Caspase-3 activation but not in Bim activation. G5PR is essential for the survival of DP cells during thymocyte development.
18022638	Structural implications of Siglec-5-mediated sialoglycan recognition.	Sialic acid (Sia) Ig-like binding lectins are important mediators of recognition and signaling events among myeloid cells. To investigate the molecular mechanism underlying sialic acid Ig-like lectin (Siglec) functions, we determined the crystal structure of the two N-terminal extracellular domains of human myeloid cell inhibitory receptor Siglec-5 (CD170) and its complexes with two sialylated carbohydrates. The native structure revealed an unusual conformation of the CC' ligand specificity loop and a unique interdomain disulfide bond. The alpha(2,3)- and alpha(2,6)-sialyllactose complexed structures showed a conserved Sia recognition motif that involves both Arg124 and a portion of the G-strand in the V-set domain forming beta-sheet-like hydrogen bonds with the glycerol side chain of the Sia. Only few protein contacts to the subterminal sugars are observed and mediated by the highly variable GG' linker and CC' loop. These structural observations, in conjunction with surface plasmon resonance binding assays, provide mechanistic insights into linkage-dependent Siglec carbohydrate recognition and suggest that Siglec-5 and other CD33-related Siglec receptors are more promiscuous in sialoglycan recognition than previously understood.
18022655	Quantitative analysis of auxin-regulated proteins from basal part of leaf sheaths in rice by two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis.	To identify the effects of auxin on rice root formation, proteins induced by exogenous addition of auxin to rice seedlings were analyzed by a proteomic approach. Root formation by rice seedlings was promoted by 0.45microM 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and repressed by 60microM p-chlorophenoxyisobutyric acid (PCIB). Proteins extracted from the basal part of leaf sheaths of rice seedlings treated with 2,4-D or PCIB for 48h were labeled with Cy3 and Cy5, and separated by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Out of nine proteins up-regulated by 2,4-D and down-regulated by PCIB, five proteins showing significant difference in abundance were used for expression analysis at the transcript abundance level. Transcript abundance of the mitochondrial complex I subunit slightly increased with 2,4-D treatment and were repressed by PCIB. The transcript abundance of EF-1beta', myosin heavy chain and mitochondrial [Mn]SOD increased with 2,4-D treatment but did not decrease with PCIB. The transcript abundance of aldehyde dehydrogenase was not effected by 2,4-D or PCIB. These results indicate that mitochondrial complex I subunit is part of the downstream signal cascade of PCIB, whereas myosin heavy chain, mitochondrial [Mn]SOD and EF-1beta' are involved in the 2,4-D signal cascade but are probably upstream of PCIB.
18022661	Development and characterization of a new single cycle vaccine vector in the simian immunodeficiency virus model system.	We have developed a new single cycle lentiviral vector, SIVsmH4i-SC27.1, as a potential SIV/HIV-1 vaccine candidate. This viral vector is capable of expressing all of the SIV gene products but is limited to one round of infection. The vector was created by mutating 27 codons dispersed among the viral vif, env, and nef genes to block protein function, attenuate viral replication/infectivity, and reduce the ability of the virus to manipulate the host immune system. To complement the env and nef replication defects, SC27.1 was pseudotyped with the VSV G glycoprotein to allow particle entry. The vif mutation was complemented by producing particles from an APOBEC3G-negative cell line, and the Vif protein defect was validated by showing that the single cycle virus lost most of its infectivity when particles were produced in presence of APOBEC3G. To deal with the problem of an antibody response to the VSV G protein in a vaccination strategy, two additional serotypes of the VSV G protein were used to create pseudotyped virus particles, and we observed no cross-neutralization activity for two of the pseudotyped particles with a potent neutralizing antiserum to one of the VSV G proteins. We detected moderate inhibition of infectivity in normal human and macaque sera, especially to the New Jersey serotype of VSV G, but as a heat sensitive activity, presumably complement mediated. These particles can be used in a prime-boost strategy to determine if a single cycle lentiviral vaccine vector capable of expressing all of the viral gene products holds promise in inducing immunity and protection to an SIVsm challenge.
18022767	Structural families of genomic microsatellites.	We present an analysis of tandem repeats of short sequence motifs (microsatellites) in twelve eukaryotes for which a large part of the genome has been sequenced and assembled. The pattern of motif abundance varies significantly in different species, but it is very similar in different chromosomes of the same species. The most abundant repeats can be classified in two main families. The first family has a rigid conformation, with purines in one strand and pyrimidines in the complementary strand, mainly A(n)/T(n) and (AG)(n)/(CT)(n). The second family has alternating, flexible sequences, such as (AT)(n), (AC)(n) and related sequences. In the pluricellular organisms the relative frequency of both families is rather constant. These observations indicate that microsatellites have structural information and may be involved in the organization of chromatin fibers and in chromosome architecture in general. An additional intriguing finding is the absence of microsatellites with sequences which appear to be forbidden, such as (AATT)(n).
18022865	Primary ciliary dyskinesia associated with normal axoneme ultrastructure is caused by DNAH11 mutations.	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is an inherited disorder characterized by perturbed or absent beating of motile cilia, which is referred to as Kartagener syndrome (KS) when associated with situs inversus. We present a German family in which five individuals have PCD and one has KS. PCD was confirmed by analysis of native and cultured respiratory ciliated epithelia with high-speed video microscopy. Respiratory ciliated cells from the affected individuals showed an abnormal nonflexible beating pattern with a reduced cilium bending capacity and a hyperkinetic beat. Interestingly, the axonemal ultrastructure of these respiratory cilia was normal and outer dynein arms were intact, as shown by electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry. Microsatellite analysis indicated genetic linkage to the dynein heavy chain DNAH11 on chromosome 7p21. All affected individuals carried the compound heterozygous DNAH11 mutations c.12384C>G and c.13552_13608del. Both mutations are located in the C-terminal domain and predict a truncated DNAH11 protein (p.Y4128X, p.A4518_A4523delinsQ). The mutations described here were not present in a cohort of 96 PCD patients. In conclusion, our findings support the view that DNAH11 mutations indeed cause PCD and KS, and that the reported DNAH11 nonsense mutations are associated with a normal axonemal ultrastructure and are compatible with normal male fertility.
18022953	Comparative functional analysis provides evidence for a crucial role for the homeobox gene Nkx2.1/Titf-1 in forebrain evolution.	Knockout of the Nkx2.1 (Titf-1) homeobox gene in the mouse leads to severe malformation and size reduction of the basal telencephalon/preoptic area and basal hypothalamus, indicating an important role of this gene in forebrain patterning. Here we show that abrogation of the orthologous gene in the frog Xenopus laevis by way of morpholino knockdown also affects the relative size of major regions in both the telencephalon (subpallium versus pallium) and diencephalon (hypothalamus versus thalamus). Remarkably, while a similar effect on the telencephalon was noted previously in Nkx2.1-knockout mice, the effect on the diencephalon seems to be specific for Xenopus. This difference may be explained by the partially dissimilar expression of the orthologous genes in the forebrain of Xenopus and mouse. In both species Nkx2.1 is expressed in the basal telencephalon/preoptic area and basal hypothalamus, but in Xenopus this gene is additionally expressed in the alar hypothalamus. Phylogenetic comparison of Nkx2.1 expression in the forebrain suggests that the expression in the basal telencephalon-preoptic region and alar hypothalamus appeared in the transition from jawless to jawed vertebrates, but the alar hypothalamic expression was later dramatically reduced during evolution to birds and mammals. Our study suggests that changes in the regulation of Nkx2.1 expression have played an important role on the evolution of forebrain development, and emphasizes the potential of the combined analysis of expression and function of master control genes in different vertebrates for unraveling the origin of brain complexity and diversity.
18022972	Unique properties of DNA interstrand cross-links of antitumor oxaliplatin and the effect of chirality of the carrier ligand.	The different antitumor and other biological effects of the third-generation antitumor platinum drug oxaliplatin [(1R,2R-diamminocyclohexane)oxalatoplatinum(II)] in comparison with those of conventional cisplatin [cis-diamminedichloridoplatinum(II)] are often explained by the ability of oxaliplatin to form DNA adducts of different conformation and consequently to exhibit different cytotoxic effects. This work describes, for the first time, the structural and biochemical characteristics of the interstrand cross-links of oxaliplatin. We find that: 1) DNA bending, unwinding, thermal destabilization, and delocalization of the conformational alteration induced by the cross-link of oxaliplatin are greater than those observed with the cross-link of cisplatin; 2) the affinity of high-mobility-group proteins (which are known to mediate the antitumor activity of platinum complexes) for the interstrand cross-links of oxaliplatin is markedly lower than for those of cisplatin; and 3) the chirality at the carrier 1,2-diaminocyclohexane ligand can affect some important structural properties of the interstrand cross-links of cisplatin analogues. Thus, the information contained in the present work is also useful for a better understanding of how the stereochemistry of the carrier amine ligands of cisplatin analogues can modulate their anticancer and mutagenic properties. The significance of this study is also reinforced by the fact that, in general, interstrand cross-links formed by various compounds of biological significance result in greater cytotoxicity than is expected for monofunctional adducts or other intrastrand DNA lesions. Therefore, we suggest that the unique properties of the interstrand cross-links of oxaliplatin are at least partly responsible for this drug's unique antitumor effects.
18023060	Individual and combined effects of the rolA, B, and C genes on anthraquinone production in Rubia cordifolia transformed calli.	It is known that the rolA, rolB, and rolC genes of Agrobacterium rhizogenes T-DNA affect processes of plant development and activate the synthesis of secondary metabolites in transformed plant cells. Although a synergistic activity of the rol genes on root formation is well-documented, little is known about their individual and combined action on secondary metabolism. In the present investigation, we provide evidence indicating that individual rolA, rolB, and rolC genes are capable of increasing biosynthesis of anthraquinones (AQs) in transformed calli of Rubia cordifolia. The stimulatory effect was due to the increased transcription of a key gene of AQ biosynthesis, the isochorismate synthase (ICS) gene. The strongest AQ-stimulating activity was shown for an R. cordifolia culture expressing rolB at high levels, where rolB ensured a 15-fold increase of AQ accumulation compared with the control, non-transformed calli. A tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor abolished the rolB-induced increase of AQ production, thus indicating the involvement of tyrosine (de)phosphorylation in the rolB-mediated AQ stimulation. The rolA- and rolC-expressing cultures produced 2.8- and 4.3-fold higher levels of AQs, respectively, when compared with the control calli. However, the effect of rolA, rolB, and rolC on AQ biosynthesis was not synergistic because rolA and rolC apparently attenuated the stimulatory effect of rolB on AQ biosynthesis. Therefore, the rol-gene-mediated signals that promote root formation and those which activate biosynthesis of secondary metabolites seem to have a point of divergence.
18023137	[Refractory asthma: diagnosing allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis].	Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) results from a twofold mechanism: Th2-like hypersensitivity reaction and bronchial colonization by Aspergillus fumigatus. This relatively rare disease occurs in immunocompetent patients in two very different situations: refractory asthma and cystic fibrosis. Diagnosis in asthma patients is relatively easy; it is based on the association of several criteria: clinical (recurrent exacerbations despite adequate therapy and a positive A. fumigatus skin prick-test), laboratory (inconsistent blood eosinophilia, high serum levels of total IgE, presence of A. fumigatus-specific IgE and IgG) and radiological (mainly central bronchiectasis, sometimes transitory pulmonary infiltrates). Diagnosis is more difficult in patients with cystic fibrosis because of the similarity of their various criteria. Long-term prognosis is good in the early stages of the illness, although the natural history and course of the disease are not fully understood. Early diagnosis and active screening for exacerbations are recommended to prevent bronchiectasis and progression to end-stage lung disease. Two drugs have shown their efficacy in treating ABPA: corticosteroids and itraconazole. They are recommended in acute exacerbations and should not be used as long-term therapy, except in corticosteroid-dependent asthma and in some cases of cystic fibrosis.
18023261	Improved binary PSO for feature selection using gene expression data.	Gene expression profiles, which represent the state of a cell at a molecular level, have great potential as a medical diagnosis tool. Compared to the number of genes involved, available training data sets generally have a fairly small sample size in cancer type classification. These training data limitations constitute a challenge to certain classification methodologies. A reliable selection method for genes relevant for sample classification is needed in order to speed up the processing rate, decrease the predictive error rate, and to avoid incomprehensibility due to the large number of genes investigated. Improved binary particle swarm optimization (IBPSO) is used in this study to implement feature selection, and the K-nearest neighbor (K-NN) method serves as an evaluator of the IBPSO for gene expression data classification problems. Experimental results show that this method effectively simplifies feature selection and reduces the total number of features needed. The classification accuracy obtained by the proposed method has the highest classification accuracy in nine of the 11 gene expression data test problems, and is comparative to the classification accuracy of the two other test problems, as compared to the best results previously published.
18023520	Long-term platelet production assessed in NOD/SCID mice injected with cord blood CD34+ cells, thrombopoietin-amplified in clinical grade serum-free culture.	OBJECTIVE: Delayed platelet recovery post-cord blood (CB) transplantation might be due to CB characteristics: low maturity of stem cell compartment, poor production of CD34+/CD41+ cells when induced to differentiate along the megakaryocytic (MK) lineage, retention of a low ploidy in the expanded MKs. Ex vivo expansion of CB hematopoietic progenitor cells for reconstitution of different human hematopoietic lineages has already been developed in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice. However, optimal conditions for MK-progenitor engraftment to reduce hemorrhaging risk still to be developed. This study assesses the hypothesis that CB-CD34+ amplification with thrombopoietin (TPO) can be applied to a portion of a CB transplant unit to stimulate recovery along MK differentiation program. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human CB-CD34+ cells were amplified in a serum-free, clinical grade medium with 100 ng/mL TPO alone and in addition to other cytokines (Kit ligand, interleukin-6, and Flt-3 ligand). Seven-day cultured cells were transplanted into irradiated NOD/SCID mice and engraftment, megakaryocytopoiesis, and platelet production were assessed. RESULTS: Platelet release was successful and continuously present for at least 8 weeks in NOD/SCID mice transplanted with CB cells stimulated by TPO. Thrombocytopoiesis was more effective with transplanted TPO-amplified cells than with the cytokine cocktails. CONCLUSION: Platelet number obtained is within the minimum level considered sufficient for hemostasis. Furthermore, amplified cells maintain their self-renewal capacity and multilineage potential differentiation. Thus, transplantation of TPO-expanded CB cells has the potential favoring both platelet recovery and human engraftment.
18023735	Delaunay-Object-Dynamics: cell mechanics with a 3D kinetic and dynamic weighted Delaunay-triangulation.	Mathematical methods in Biology are of increasing relevance for understanding the control and the dynamics of biological systems with medical relevance. In particular, agent-based methods turn more and more important because of fast increasing computational power which makes even large systems accessible. An overview of different mathematical methods used in Theoretical Biology is provided and a novel agent-based method for cell mechanics based on Delaunay-triangulations and Voronoi-tessellations is explained in more detail: The Delaunay-Object-Dynamics method. It is claimed that the model combines physically realistic cell mechanics with a reasonable computational load. The power of the approach is illustrated with two examples, avascular tumor growth and genesis of lymphoid tissue in a cell-flow equilibrium.
18023739	Complex multicellular systems and immune competition: new paradigms looking for a mathematical theory.	This chapter deals with the modeling and simulation of large systems of interacting entities whose microscopic state includes not only geometrical and mechanical variables (typically position and velocity), but also biological functions or specific activities. The main issue looks at the development of a biological mathematical theory for multicellular systems. The first part is devoted to the derivation of mathematical structures to be properly used to model a variety of biological phenomena with special focus on immune competition. Then, some specific applications are proposed referring to the competition between neoplastic and immune cells. Finally, the last part is devoted to research perspectives towards the objective of developing a mathematical-biological theory. A critique is presented of what has already been achieved towards the above target and what is still missing with special focus on multiscale systems.
18024138	Probing lipid- and drug-binding domains with fluorescent dyes.	A series of 2- and 3-OH Nile red dyes was prepared in order to generate water-soluble probes that could be used to probe lipid binding to proteins. Various substitutions in positions 2-/3-, 6-, and 7-shifted wavelengths while maintaining the environmental sensitivity of Nile red. In order to increase the solubility of the dyes in aqueous solutions, we attached butyric acid groups to the 2- or 3-OH position. In addition, phenothiazine dyes, which exhibited particularly long excitation properties, were synthesized and tested for the first time. All dyes showed Stoke's shifts of 70-100 nm and changes in excitation and emission of over 100 nm, depending on the hydrophobicity of the environment. Binding studies with bovine serum albumin and the non-specific lipid transfer protein SCP2 revealed emission changes of more than 30 nm upon binding to the protein and a five-fold increase in emission intensity. Titration of the dye-loaded proteins with various lipids or drugs replaced the dye and thereby reversed the shift in wavelength intensity. This allowed us to estimate the lipid binding affinity of the investigated proteins. For SCP2, isothermal calorimetry (ITC) data verified the titration experiments. NMR titration experiments of SCP2 with Nile red 2-O-butyric acid (1a) revealed that the dye is bound within the lipid binding pocket and competes with lipid ligands for this binding site. These results give valuable insight into lipid and drug transport by proteins outside and inside cells.
18024247	Biomarker discovery for kidney diseases by mass spectrometry.	By the development of soft ionization such as matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) and electrospray ionization (ESI), mass spectrometry (MS) has become an indispensable technique to analyze proteins. The combination of protein separation and identification such as two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and MS, surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization-MS, liquid chromatography/MS, and capillary electrophoresis/MS has been successfully applied for proteome analysis of urine and plasma to discover biomarkers of kidney diseases. Some urinary proteins and their proteolytic fragments have been identified as biomarker candidates for kidney diseases. This article reviews recent advances in the application of proteomics using MS to discover biomarkers for kidney diseases.
18024360	Metal-to-insulator transition and superconductivity in boron-doped diamond.	The experimental discovery of superconductivity in boron-doped diamond came as a major surprise to both the diamond and the superconducting materials communities. The main experimental results obtained since then on single-crystal diamond epilayers are reviewed and applied to calculations, and some open questions are identified. The critical doping of the metal-to-insulator transition (MIT) was found to coincide with that necessary for superconductivity to occur. Some of the critical exponents of the MIT were determined and superconducting diamond was found to follow a conventional type II behaviour in the dirty limit, with relatively high critical temperature values quite close to the doping-induced insulator-to-metal transition. This could indicate that on the metallic side both the electron-phonon coupling and the screening parameter depend on the boron concentration. In our view, doped diamond is a potential model system for the study of electronic phase transitions and a stimulating example for other semiconductors such as germanium and silicon.
18024517	PhyR is involved in the general stress response of Methylobacterium extorquens AM1.	PhyR represents a novel alphaproteobacterial family of response regulators having a structure consisting of two domains; a predicted amino-terminal extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factor-like domain and a carboxy-terminal receiver domain. PhyR was first described in Methylobacterium extorquens AM1, in which it has been shown to be essential for plant colonization, probably due to its suggested involvement in the regulation of a number of stress proteins. Here we investigated the PhyR regulon using microarray technology. We found that the PhyR regulon is rather large and that most of the 246 targets are under positive control. Mapping of transcriptional start sites revealed candidate promoters for PhyR-mediated regulation. One of these promoters, an ECF-type promoter, was identified upstream of one-third of the target genes by in silico analysis. Among the PhyR targets are genes predicted to be involved in multiple stress responses, including katE, osmC, htrA, dnaK, gloA, dps, and uvrA. The induction of these genes is consistent with our phenotypic analyses which revealed that PhyR is involved in resistance to heat shock and desiccation, as well as oxidative, UV, ethanol, and osmotic stresses, in M. extorquens AM1. The finding that PhyR is involved in the general stress response was further substantiated by the finding that carbon starvation induces protection against heat shock and that this protection is at least in part dependent on PhyR.
18024556	PHYTOCHROME KINASE SUBSTRATE1 regulates root phototropism and gravitropism.	Light promotes the expression of PHYTOCHROME KINASE SUBSTRATE1 (PKS1) in the root of Arabidopsis thaliana, but the function of PKS1 in this organ is unknown. Unilateral blue light induced a negative root phototropic response mediated by phototropin 1 in wild-type seedlings. This response was absent in pks1 mutants. In the wild type, unilateral blue light enhanced PKS1 expression in the subapical region of the root several hours before bending was detectable. The negative phototropism and the enhanced PKS1 expression in response to blue light required phytochrome A (phyA). In addition, the pks1 mutation enhanced the root gravitropic response when vertically oriented seedlings were placed horizontally. The negative regulation of gravitropism by PKS1 occurred even in dark-grown seedlings and did not require phyA. Blue light also failed to induce negative phototropism in pks1 under reduced gravitational stimulation, indicating that the effect of pks1 on phototropism is not simply the consequence of the counteracting effect of enhanced gravitropism. We propose a model where the background level of PKS1 reduces gravitropism. After a phyA-dependent increase in its expression, PKS1 positively affects root phototropism and both effects contribute to negative curvature in response to unilateral blue light.
18024679	The cytochrome P450 lanosterol 14alpha-demethylase gene is a demethylation inhibitor fungicide resistance determinant in Monilinia fructicola field isolates from Georgia.	Resistance in Monilinia fructicola to demethylation inhibitor (DMI) fungicides is beginning to emerge in North America, but its molecular basis is unknown. Two potential genetic determinants of DMI fungicide resistance including the 14alpha-demethylase gene (MfCYP51) and the ATP-binding cassette transporter gene MfABC1, were investigated in six resistant (DMI-R) and six sensitive (DMI-S) field isolates. No point mutations leading to an amino acid change were found in the MfCYP51 gene. The constitutive expression of the MfCYP51 gene in DMI-R isolates was significantly higher compared to DMI-S isolates. Gene expression was not induced in mycelium of DMI-R or DMI-S isolates treated with 0.3 mug of propiconazole/ml. A slightly higher average MfCYP51 copy number value was detected in DMI-R isolates (1.35) compared to DMI-S isolates (1.13); however, this difference could not be verified in Southern hybridization experiments or explain the up to 11-fold-increased MfCYP51 mRNA levels in DMI-R isolates. Analysis of the upstream nucleotide sequence of the MfCYP51 gene revealed a unique 65-bp repetitive element at base pair position -117 from the translational start site in DMI-R isolates but not in DMI-S isolates. This repetitive element contained a putative promoter and was named Mona. The link between Mona and the DMI resistance phenotype became even more apparent after studying the genetic diversity between the isolates. In contrast to DMI-S isolates, DMI-R isolates contained an MfCYP51 gene of identical nucleotide sequence associated with Mona. Still, DMI-R isolates were not genetically identical as revealed by Microsatellite-PCR analysis. Also, real-time PCR analysis of genomic DNA indicated that the relative copy number of Mona among DMI-S and DMI-R isolates varied, suggesting its potential for mobility. Interestingly, constitutive expression of the MfABC1 gene in DMI-R isolates was slightly lower than that of DMI-S isolates, but expression of the MfABC1 gene in DMI-R isolates was induced in mycelium after propiconazole treatment. Therefore, the MfABC1 gene may play a minor role in DMI fungicide resistance in M. fructicola. Our results strongly suggest that overexpression of the MfCYP51 gene is an important mechanism in conferring DMI fungicide resistance in M. fructicola field isolates from Georgia and that this overexpression is correlated with Mona located upstream of the MfCYP51 gene.
18024968	A hierarchical statistical model to assess the confidence of peptides and proteins inferred from tandem mass spectrometry.	MOTIVATION: Statistical evaluation of the confidence of peptide and protein identifications made by tandem mass spectrometry is a critical component for appropriately interpreting the experimental data and conducting downstream analysis. Although many approaches have been developed to assign confidence measure from different perspectives, a unified statistical framework that integrates the uncertainty of peptides and proteins is still missing. RESULTS: We developed a hierarchical statistical model (HSM) that jointly models the uncertainty of the identified peptides and proteins and can be applied to any scoring system. With data sets of a standard mixture and the yeast proteome, we demonstrate that the HSM offers a reliable or at least conservative false discovery rate (FDR) estimate for peptide and protein identifications. The probability measure of HSM also offers a powerful discriminating score for peptide identification. AVAILABILITY: The algorithm is available upon request from the authors.
18025003	Clustering of change patterns using Fourier coefficients.	MOTIVATION: To understand the behavior of genes, it is important to explore how the patterns of gene expression change over a time period because biologically related gene groups can share the same change patterns. Many clustering algorithms have been proposed to group observation data. However, because of the complexity of the underlying functions there have not been many studies on grouping data based on change patterns. In this study, the problem of finding similar change patterns is induced to clustering with the derivative Fourier coefficients. The sample Fourier coefficients not only provide information about the underlying functions, but also reduce the dimension. In addition, as their limiting distribution is a multivariate normal, a model-based clustering method incorporating statistical properties would be appropriate. RESULTS: This work is aimed at discovering gene groups with similar change patterns that share similar biological properties. We developed a statistical model using derivative Fourier coefficients to identify similar change patterns of gene expression. We used a model-based method to cluster the Fourier series estimation of derivatives. The model-based method is advantageous over other methods in our proposed model because the sample Fourier coefficients asymptotically follow the multivariate normal distribution. Change patterns are automatically estimated with the Fourier representation in our model. Our model was tested in simulations and on real gene data sets. The simulation results showed that the model-based clustering method with the sample Fourier coefficients has a lower clustering error rate than K-means clustering. Even when the number of repeated time points was small, the same results were obtained. We also applied our model to cluster change patterns of yeast cell cycle microarray expression data with alpha-factor synchronization. It showed that, as the method clusters with the probability-neighboring data, the model-based clustering with our proposed model yielded biologically interpretable results. We expect that our proposed Fourier analysis with suitably chosen smoothing parameters could serve as a useful tool in classifying genes and interpreting possible biological change patterns.

18025037	SUMO1 negatively regulates BRCA1-mediated transcription, via modulation of promoter occupancy.	BRCA1, a tumor suppressor gene, is implicated in the repression and activation of transcription via interactions with a diverse range of proteins. The mechanisms regulating the action of BRCA1 are not fully understood. Here, we use the promoters of Gadd45alpha, p27(KIP1) and p21(WAF1/CIP1) to demonstrate that SUMO1 represses transactivation potential of BRCA1 by causing BRCA1 to be released from the promoters and augmenting histone deacetylation via recruitment of histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity. Consistently, silencing of SUMO1 led to recruitment of BRCA1 and release of HDAC1 at the BRCA1 target promoters, and subsequent transcriptional activation of the BRCA1 target genes. Furthermore, a sumoylation-incompetent mutant missing the sumoylation donor site suppressed BRCA1-induced activation of transcription, whereas E2 UBC9 or the dominant-negative mutant UBC9 had no effect, implying that repression of BRCA1-mediated activation of transcription by SUMO1 is independent of sumoylation. Repression of BRCA1-mediated activation of transcription by SUMO1 was reversed by DNA damage by inducing the release of SUMO1 from the Gadd45alpha promoter and the recruitment of BRCA1, along with increased histone acetylation, to enhance activation of transcription. Together, our data provide evidence that SUMO1 plays a role in the activation-repression switch of BRCA1-mediated transcription via modulation of promoter occupancy.
18025044	Ex vivo correction of selenoprotein N deficiency in rigid spine muscular dystrophy caused by a mutation in the selenocysteine codon.	Premature termination of translation due to nonsense mutations is a frequent cause of inherited diseases. Therefore, many efforts were invested in the development of strategies or compounds to selectively suppress this default. Selenoproteins are interesting candidates considering the idiosyncrasy of the amino acid selenocysteine (Sec) insertion mechanism. Here, we focused our studies on SEPN1, a selenoprotein gene whose mutations entail genetic disorders resulting in different forms of muscular diseases. Selective correction of a nonsense mutation at the Sec codon (UGA to UAA) was undertaken with a corrector tRNA(Sec) that was engineered to harbor a compensatory mutation in the anticodon. We demonstrated that its expression restored synthesis of a full-length selenoprotein N both in HeLa cells and in skin fibroblasts from a patient carrying the mutated Sec codon. Readthrough of the UAA codon was effectively dependent on the Sec insertion machinery, therefore being highly selective for this gene and unlikely to generate off-target effects. In addition, we observed that expression of the corrector tRNA(Sec) stabilized the mutated SEPN1 transcript that was otherwise more subject to degradation. In conclusion, our data provide interesting evidence that premature termination of translation due to nonsense mutations is amenable to correction, in the context of the specialized selenoprotein synthesis mechanism.
18025105	Global role for polyadenylation-assisted nuclear RNA degradation in posttranscriptional gene silencing.	Fission yeast Cid14, a component of the TRAMP (Cid14/Trf4-Air1-Mtr4 polyadenylation) complex, polyadenylates nuclear RNA and stimulates degradation by the exosome for RNA quality control. Here, we analyze patterns of global gene expression in cells lacking the Cid14 or the Dis3/Rpr44 subunit of the nuclear exosome. We found that transcripts from many genes induced during meiosis, including key regulators, accumulated in the absence of Cid14 or Dis3. Moreover, our data suggest that additional substrates include transcripts involved in heterochromatin assembly. Mutant cells lacking Cid14 and/or Dis3 accumulate transcripts corresponding to naturally silenced repeat elements within heterochromatic domains, reflecting defects in centromeric gene silencing and derepression of subtelomeric gene expression. We also uncover roles for Cid14 and Dis3 in maintaining the genomic integrity of ribosomal DNA. Our data indicate that polyadenylation-assisted nuclear RNA turnover functions in eliminating a variety of RNA targets to control diverse processes, such as heterochromatic gene silencing, meiotic differentiation, and maintenance of genomic integrity.
18026732	Isolation and characterization of genomic retrotransposon sequences from octoploid strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa Duch.).	Strawberry (Fragaria spp.) is a kind of herbaceous perennial plant that propagates vegetatively. The conserved domains of reverse transcriptase (RT) genes of Ty1-copia and Ty3-gypsy groups of LTR retrotransposons were amplified from the cultivated strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa Duch.). Sequence analysis of clones demonstrated that 5 of 19 Ty1-copia group unique sequences and 2 of 10 Ty3-gypsy unique sequences in F. x ananassa genome possessed either stop codon or frameshift. Ty1-copia group sequences are highly heterogeneous (divergence ranged from 1 to 69.8%), but the Ty3-gypsy group sequences are less (divergence ranged from 1 to 10%). Southern dot blot hybridization result suggested that both of the LTR retrotransposons are present in the genome of cultivated strawberry with high copy number (Ty1-copia group 2,875 Ty3-gypsy group 348). RT-PCR amplification from total RNA, which was extracted from leaves of micropropagated strawberry plants, did not yield either of the RT fragments. This is the first report on the presence of RT sequences of Ty1-copia and Ty3-gypsy group retrotransposons in F. x ananassa genome.
18026837	Effect of portal hypertension in the small bowel: an endoscopic approach.	BACKGROUND AND AIM: The effects of portal hypertension in the small bowel are largely unknown. The aim of the study was to prospectively assess portal hypertension manifestations in the small bowel. METHODS: We compared, by performing enteroscopy with capsule endoscopy, the endoscopic findings of 36 patients with portal hypertension, 25 cirrhotic and 11 non-cirrhotic, with 30 controls. RESULTS: Varices, defined as distended, tortuous, or saccular veins, and areas of mucosa with a reticulate pattern were significantly more frequent in patients with PTH. These two findings were detected in 26 of the 66 patients (39%), 25 from the group with PTH (69%) and one from the control group (3%) (P < 0.0001). Among the 25 patients with PTH exhibiting these patterns, 17 were cirrhotic and 8 were non-cirrhotic (P = 0.551). The presence of these endoscopic changes was not related to age, gender, presence of cirrhosis, esophageal or gastric varices, portal hypertensive gastropathy, portal hypertensive colopathy, prior esophageal endoscopic treatment, current administration of beta-blockers, or Child-Pugh Class C. More patients with these endoscopic patterns had a previous history of acute digestive bleeding (72% vs. 36%) (P = 0.05). Active bleeding was found in two patients (5.5%). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of varices or areas of mucosa with a reticulate pattern are manifestations of portal hypertension in the small bowel, found in both cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic patients. The clinical implications of these findings, as regards digestive bleeding, are uncertain, although we documented acute bleeding from the small bowel in two patients (5.5%).
18026957	Transgenic approaches for abiotic stress tolerance in plants: retrospect and prospects.	Abiotic stresses including drought are serious threats to the sustainability of crop yields accounting for more crop productivity losses than any other factor in rainfed agriculture. Success in breeding for better adapted varieties to abiotic stresses depend upon the concerted efforts by various research domains including plant and cell physiology, molecular biology, genetics, and breeding. Use of modern molecular biology tools for elucidating the control mechanisms of abiotic stress tolerance, and for engineering stress tolerant crops is based on the expression of specific stress-related genes. Hence, genetic engineering for developing stress tolerant plants, based on the introgression of genes that are known to be involved in stress response and putative tolerance, might prove to be a faster track towards improving crop varieties. Far beyond the initial attempts to insert "single-action" genes, engineering of the regulatory machinery involving transcription factors has emerged as a new tool now for controlling the expression of many stress-responsive genes. Nevertheless, the task of generating transgenic cultivars is not only limited to the success in the transformation process, but also proper incorporation of the stress tolerance. Evaluation of the transgenic plants under stress conditions, and understanding the physiological effect of the inserted genes at the whole plant level remain as major challenges to overcome. This review focuses on the recent progress in using transgenic technology for the improvement of abiotic stress tolerance in plants. This includes discussion on the evaluation of abiotic stress response and the protocols for testing the transgenic plants for their tolerance under close-to-field conditions.
18026986	Isolate-specific effects of ultraviolet radiation on photosynthesis, growth and mycosporine-like amino acids in the microbial mat-forming cyanobacterium Microcoleus chthonoplastes.	Microcoleus chthonoplastes constitutes one of the dominant microorganisms in intertidal microbial mat communities. In the laboratory, the effects of repeated daily exposure to ultraviolet radiation (16:8 light:dark cycle) was investigated in unicyanobacterial cultures isolated from three different localities (Baltic Sea = WW6; North Sea = STO and Brittany = BRE). Photosynthesis and growth were measured in time series (12-15 days) while UV-absorbing mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) and cellular integrity were determined after 12 and 3 days exposure to three radiation treatments [PAR (22 mumol photon m(-2) s(-1)) = P; PAR + UV-A (8 W m(-2)) = PA; PAR + UV-A + UV-B (0.4 W m(-2)) = PAB]. Isolate-specific responses to UVR were observed. The proximate response to radiation stress after 1-day treatment showed that isolate WW6 was the most sensitive to UVR. However, repeated exposure to radiation stress indicated that photosynthetic efficiency (F (v)/F (m)) of WW6 acclimated to UVR. Conversely, although photosynthesis in STO exhibited lower reduction in F (v)/F (m) during the first day, the values declined over time. The BRE isolate was the most tolerant to radiation stress with the lowest reduction in F (v)/F (m )sustained over time. While photosynthetic efficiencies of different isolates were able to acclimate to UVR, growth did not. The discrepancy seems to be due to the higher cell density used for photosynthesis compared to the growth measurement. Apparently, the cell density used for photosynthesis was not high enough to offer self-shading protection because cellular damage was also observed in those filaments under UVR. Most likely, the UVR acclimation of photosynthesis reflects predominantly the performance of the surviving cells within the filaments. Different strategies were observed in MAAs synthesis. Total MAAs content in WW6 was not significantly different between all the radiation treatments. In contrast, the additional fluence of UV-A and UV-B significantly increased MAAs synthesis and accumulation in STO while only UV-B fluence significantly increased MAAs content in BRE. Regardless of the dynamic photosynthetic recovery process and potential UV-protective functions of MAAs, cellular investigation showed that UV-B significantly contributed to an increased cell mortality in single filaments. In their natural mat habitat, M. chthonoplastes benefits from closely associated cyanobacteria which are highly UVR-tolerant due to the production of the extracellular UV-sunscreen scytonemin.
18026991	The value of combined use of survivin, cytokeratin 20 and mucin 7 mRNA for bladder cancer detection in voided urine.	OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the value of combined use of survivin, cytokeratin (CK) 20 and mucin (MUC) 7 mRNA in comparison with voided urine cytology in the detection of bladder cancer patients. METHODS: One hundred and fifty three patients and 20 healthy volunteers were evaluated by RT-PCR for detecting survivin, CK-20 and MUC7 mRNA in voided urine before cystoscopy. The three markers and cytology were evaluated independently or in combinations. RESULTS: The overall sensitivity and specificity were 90.4 and 94.7% for survivin, 82.6 and 97.4% for CK-20, 62.6 and 94.7% for MUC7 and 46.0 and 100% for voided urine cytology. Combined sensitivity of voided urine cytology with the three biomarkers together was higher than either combined sensitivity of voided urine cytology with one of the biomarkers or than that of the biomarker alone. CONCLUSIONS: Combined use of the three markers can improve the sensitivity for detecting bladder cancer.
18028246	Frequency and impact of allergic rhinitis in asthma patients in everyday general medical practice: a French observational cross-sectional study.	BACKGROUND: Allergic rhinitis (AR) and asthma are inflammatory conditions of the airways that often occur concomitantly. This observational, cross-sectional, national study was undertaken to describe the frequency and severity of AR in asthmatic patients. The impact of AR on the quality of life and the therapeutic management of patients in everyday general medical practice were also assessed. METHODS: From April to October 2005, 1906 French general practitioners (GP) participated in the study. Each physician had to fill out a questionnaire (including the Juniper Asthma Control Questionnaire and a Rhinitis Questionnaire) for up to 10 consecutive adult asthmatic patients. The first three patients with a confirmed diagnosis of AR (Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma classification) were asked to complete the Juniper Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ). RESULTS: A total of 14,703 patient questionnaires and 4335 auto-questionnaires were analysed. Patients presented with intermittent (45%), mild (25%), moderate (25%) and severe (4%) persistent asthma. The frequency of AR in asthmatic patients was 55.2% (CI: 95%, 54.4-56.0%). Allergic rhinitis was mild for 54% and moderate/severe for 46% of patients. The frequency and severity of AR increased with the severity of asthma (P < 0.001). Moreover, AR was associated with worse asthma control whatever be the severity of asthma (P < 0.001). The global RQLQ scores of AR patients worsened with the severity of asthma (P < 0.001). Prescription of anti-asthma treatments significantly increased with the severity of AR. The majority of AR patients (81%) were treated for rhinitis. CONCLUSIONS: This survey suggested that AR was associated with more severe asthma, more difficulty to control asthma and substantial impairment of quality of life. The high frequency of AR in asthma patients requires that these conditions should be recognized and managed by GP.
18028272	Establishing a cord blood banking and transplantation program in Mexico: a single institution experience.	BACKGROUND: Over the past decade, umbilical cord blood (UCB) banking and transplantation have increased significantly worldwide. The experience in developing countries, however, is still limited. In January 2005 the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) initiated its UCB banking and transplantation program. This study reports on the experience generated at this institution during the first 2 years of activities. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A public UCB bank was established at La Raza Medical Center, IMSS, in Mexico City. Good manufacturing practices and standard operating procedures were used to address donor selection, as well as UCB collection, processing, and cryopreservation. Based mainly on human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and total nucleated cell (TNC) content, specific UCB units were thawed, processed, and released for transplantation. RESULTS: Based on stringent selection criteria, 360 UCB units were collected from January 2005 to December 2006. A total of 201 (56%) units (minimum volume, 50 mL without anticoagulant) were processed and stored. Median values for specific parameters were as follows: volume, 89.9 mL; viability, 94.8%; TNCs, 0.91 x 10(9); CD34+ cells, 3.13 x 10(6); and colony-forming cells, 1.20 x 10(6). During this period, 10 units had been released for transplantation to seven patients (six children and one adult). Engraftment was observed in five patients; four of them were still in remission (114-293 days after transplant). In spite of showing sustained engraftment, one patient died on Day +88. Two patients showed no engraftment and died 29 to 30 days after transplant. CONCLUSION: The results obtained during this initial period are encouraging and indicate that the UCB banking and transplantation program at IMSS will help to improve already existing hematopoietic cell transplant programs in Mexico. The experience generated at IMSS may be helpful to other institutions, particularly those in developing countries.
18028279	Regulation of nitrate reductase by nitric oxide in Chinese cabbage pakchoi (Brassica chinensis L.).	Nitrate reductase (NR), a committed enzyme in nitrate assimilation, involves generation of nitric oxide (NO) in plants. Here we show that the NR activity was significantly enhanced by the addition of NO donors sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and NONOate (diethylamine NONOate sodium) to the culturing solution, whereas it was decreased by NO scavenger 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-imidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (cPTIO). Interestingly, both NO gas and SNP directly enhanced but cPTIO inhibited the NR activities of crude enzyme extracts and purified NR enzyme. The cPTIO terminated the interaction between NR-generated NO and the NR itself. Furthermore, the NR protein content was not affected by the SNP treatment. The investigation of the partial reactions catalysed by purified NR using various electron donors and acceptors indicated that the haem and molybdenum centres in NR were the two sites activated by NO. The results suggest that the activation of NR activity by NO is regulated at the post-translational level, probably via a direct interaction mechanism. Accordingly, the concentration of nitrate both in leaves and roots was decreased after 2 weeks of cultivation with SNP. The present study identifies a new mechanism of NR regulation and nitrate assimilation, which provides important new insights into the complex regulation of N-metabolism in plants.
18028400	Glycerol induces reuterin production and decreases Escherichia coli population in an in vitro model of colonic fermentation with immobilized human feces.	Lactobacillus reuteri ATCC 55730 is a probiotic strain that produces, in the presence of glycerol, reuterin, a broad-spectrum antimicrobial substance. This strain has been shown to prevent intestinal infections in vivo; however, its mechanisms of action, and more specifically whether reuterin production occurs within the intestinal tract, are not known. In this study, the effects of L. reuteri ATCC 55730 on intestinal microbiota and its capacity to secrete reuterin from glycerol in a novel in vitro colonic fermentation model were tested. Two reactors were inoculated with adult immobilized fecal microbiota and the effects of daily addition of L. reuteri into one of the reactors (c.10(8) CFU mL(-1)) without or with glycerol were tested on major bacterial populations and compared with addition of glycerol or reuterin alone. The addition of glycerol alone or with L. reuteri increased numbers of the Lactobacillus-Enterococcus group and decreased Escherichia coli. The addition of reuterin significantly and selectively decreased E. coli without affecting other bacterial populations. The observed decrease in E. coli concentration during the addition of glycerol (in presence or absence of L. reuteri) could be due to in situ reuterin production because 1,3-propanediol, a typical product of glycerol fermentation, was detected during the addition of glycerol.
18028466	Tuberculin reactivity and allergic disorders in schoolchildren, Okinawa, Japan.	BACKGROUND: Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination triggers a T-helper type 1 response. Whether BCG vaccination and positive tuberculin reactivity are preventive against allergic disorders remains controversial. OBJECTIVE: The current cross-sectional study investigated the relationship of BCG vaccination and tuberculin reactivity with the prevalence of allergic disorders using data from the Ryukyus Child Health Study (RYUCHS). METHODS: Subjects were 5717 schoolchildren aged 8-11 years in Okinawa, Japan. The RYUCHS collected information on symptoms of allergic disorders and potential confounding factors. The outcomes were based on diagnostic criteria from the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood. Data on BCG vaccination and tuberculin tests were obtained from school records. Allowance was made for grade, sex, sibship size, smoking in the household, paternal and maternal history of asthma, atopic eczema, and allergic rhinitis, and paternal and maternal educational level. RESULTS: No measurable relationship was found between BCG vaccination in infants and the prevalence of allergic disorders. Among 5567 BCG-vaccinated children, positive tuberculin reactivity (induration >/=10 mm) in the first grade was independently associated with a decreased prevalence of wheeze, asthma, and atopic eczema: the multivariate odds ratios for wheeze, asthma, and atopic eczema were 0.80 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.67-0.94), 0.78 (95% CI, 0.64-0.95), and 0.77 (95% CI, 0.62-0.95), respectively. The inverse associations were more pronounced in children with a negative parental allergic history than in those with a positive parental allergic history. There was no significant relationship between tuberculin reactivity and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that positive tuberculin reactivity may be inversely associated with the prevalence of wheeze, asthma, and atopic eczema, but not allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, especially among Japanese children without a parental allergic history.
18029027	Exploring the borders of the schizoaffective spectrum: a categorical and dimensional approach.	BACKGROUND: Schizoaffective disorder has long been considered as an intermediate condition between major mood disorders and schizophrenia, however, the nature of the relationship to these diagnoses remains unclear. We aimed at examining the nature of such a relationship in a mixed sample of psychotic disorders by using a dimensional and categorical approach to psychopathology. METHODS: Six-hundred and sixty psychotic inpatients were assessed for lifetime ratings of mania, depression, psychosis and incongruence, diagnosed according to Research Diagnostic Criteria, and classified as having nonaffective psychosis without mood syndromes (n=429), nonaffective psychosis with mood syndromes (n=101), schizoaffective disorder mainly schizophrenic (n=41), schizoaffective disorder mainly affective (n=42) or mood disorder with psychotic symptoms (n=47). We tested for associations of illness-related features including risk factors, premorbid, clinical and outcome variables with classes of disorders and lifetime ratings of psychopathology, and examined the relative contribution of categorical and dimensional representations of psychopathology in explaining disease characteristics. RESULTS: While categories at the extreme end of the psychotic spectrum meaningfully differed across a number of the illness-related variables, no substantial discontinuity was apparent between adjacent categories of psychotic disorders. Risk factors, premorbid adjustment, clinical features and impairment appeared to be present in a mostly monotonic continuous fashion from nonaffective psychoses to mood disorders with psychotic features. The overall association pattern of illness-related variables with mood and psychotic syndromes was largely independent of specific diagnostic categories, and the dimensional approach was neatly superior to the traditional diagnostic approach in explaining the characteristics of the illness. LIMITATIONS: This was a cross-sectional study with retrospective assessment of illness-related-variables and lifetime psychopathology. CONCLUSION: The results are compatible with the notion of the schizoaffective spectrum and with a continuum model of the psychotic illness.
18029052	Identification of genes involved in squamous cell carcinoma of the lung using synchronized data from DNA copy number and transcript expression profiling analysis.	Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the world and squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC) is the second most common in this group. Genomic DNA copy number alterations are fundamental genetic events in the development and progression of SqCC as well as other epithelial-derived cancers. The ability to identify tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) and oncogenes that are affected during tumor initiation and progression could facilitate the identification of novel molecular targets for therapeutic intervention and provide diagnostic biomarkers. Despite the association of many genetic alterations in lung cancer the molecular mechanisms of tumor progression remain ambiguous since often too many candidates are revealed using conventional genetic microarray analysis. To overcome this limitation, we have identified genes in SqCC which show concordant gene expression changes defined using microarray analysis with DNA copy number alterations defined by BAC-array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) in the same tumors. An in-house overlay algorithm was used to synchronize the data resulting from the two analyses. Although the expression levels of many genes were altered when compared to normal controls, those which correlated with copy number changes were far fewer, providing a manageable number for biological studies. We identified over 2000 genes which displayed both gene expression alterations and mapped to BACs which demonstrated a corresponding loss or gain. A further stringent statistical analysis identified minimal regions of overlap for losses or gains which displayed a coincident decrease or increase in the expression of genes mapping to those regions. Consistent gains involved 3q23-q29, 5p15.1-q11.1 and chromosomes 18 and 20, while consistent losses involved 3p26.3-p12.3, 9p24.3-q34.3, and chromosomes 17 and 19. The concordance finding between these two approaches suggests that DNA copy number alterations can directly influence gene expression patterns that impact on tumorigenesis in SqCC of the lung.
18029076	Anti-inflammatory activity of mangostins from Garcinia mangostana.	The fruit hull of Garcinia mangostana Linn (Guttiferae) is used as an anti-inflammatory drug in Southeast Asia. Two xanthones, alpha- and gamma-mangostins, were isolated from the fruit hull of G. mangostana, and both significantly inhibited nitric oxide (NO) and PGE(2) production from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. The IC(50) values for the inhibition of NO production by alpha- and gamma-mangostins were 12.4 and 10.1 microM, respectively. After iNOS enzyme activity was stimulated by LPS for 12 h, treatment with either alpha- or gamma-mangostin at 5 microg/ml (12.2 and 12.6 microM, respectively) for 24 h did not significantly inhibit NO production. The data show that the inhibitory activities of alpha- and gamma-mangostins are not due to direct inhibition of iNOS enzyme activity. On the other hand, expression of iNOS was inhibited by alpha- and gamma-mangostins in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells, but not by COX-2. However, the level of PGE(2) production was reduced by the two xanthones. In an in vivo study, alpha-mangostin significantly inhibited mice carrageenan-induced paw edema. In conclusion, alpha- and gamma-mangostins from G. mangostana are bioactive substances with anti-inflammatory effects.
18029110	Image-guided radiotherapy via daily online cone-beam CT substantially reduces margin requirements for stereotactic lung radiotherapy.	PURPOSE: To determine treatment accuracy and margins for stereotactic lung radiotherapy with and without cone-beam CT (CBCT) image guidance. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Acquired for the study were 308 CBCT of 24 patients with solitary peripheral lung tumors treated with stereotactic radiotherapy. Patients were immobilized in a stereotactic body frame (SBF) or alpha-cradle and treated with image guidance using daily CBCT. Four (T1) or five (T2/metastatic) 12-Gy fractions were prescribed to the planning target volume (PTV) edge. The PTV margin was >or=5 mm depending on a pretreatment estimate of tumor excursion. Initial daily setup was according to SBF coordinates or tattoos for alpha-cradle cases. A CBCT was performed and registered to the planning CT using soft tissue registration of the target. The initial setup error/precorrection position, was recorded for the superior-inferior, anterior-posterior, and medial-lateral directions. The couch was adjusted to correct the tumor positional error. A second CBCT verified tumor position after correction. Patients were treated in the corrected position after the residual errors were <or=2 mm. A final CBCT after treatment assessed intrafraction tumor displacement. RESULTS: The precorrection systematic (Sigma) and random errors (sigma) for the population ranged from 2-3 mm for SBF and 2-6 mm for alpha-cradle patients; postcorrection errors ranged from 0.4-1.0 mm. Calculated population margins were 9 to 13 mm (SBF) and 10-14 mm (cradle) precorrection, 1-2 mm (SBF), and 2-3 mm (cradle) postcorrection, and 2-4 mm (SBF) and 2-5 mm (cradle) posttreatment. CONCLUSIONS: Setup for stereotactic lung radiotherapy using a SBF or alpha-cradle alone is suboptimal. CBCT image guidance significantly improves target positioning and substantially reduces required target margins and normal tissue irradiation.
18029161	The basement membrane microenvironment directs the normalization and survival of bioengineered human skin equivalents.	Epithelial-mesenchymal interactions promote the morphogenesis and homeostasis of human skin. However, the role of the basement membrane (BM) during this process is not well-understood. To directly study how BM proteins influence epidermal differentiation, survival and growth, we developed novel 3D human skin equivalents (HSEs). These tissues were generated by growing keratinocytes at an air-liquid interface on polycarbonate membranes coated with individual matrix proteins (Type I Collagen, Type IV Collagen or fibronectin) that were placed on contracted Type I Collagen gels populated with dermal fibroblasts. We found that only keratinocytes grown on membranes coated with the BM protein Type IV Collagen showed optimal tissue architecture that was similar to control tissues grown on de-epidermalized dermis (AlloDerm) that contained intact BM. In contrast, tissues grown on proteins not found in BM, such as fibronectin and Type I Collagen, demonstrated aberrant tissue architecture that was linked to a significant elevation in apoptosis and lower levels of proliferation of basal keratinocytes. While all tissues demonstrated a normalized, linear pattern of deposition of laminin 5, tissues grown on Type IV Collagen showed elevated expression of alpha6 integrin, Type IV Collagen and Type VII Collagen, suggesting induction of BM organization. Keratinocyte differentiation (Keratin 1 and filaggrin) was not dependent on the presence of BM proteins. Thus, Type IV Collagen acts as a critical microenvironmental factor in the BM that is needed to sustain keratinocyte growth and survival and to optimize epithelial architecture.
18029213	Preoperative considerations and outcomes of primary intraocular lens implantation in children with posterior polar and posterior lentiglobus cataract.	PURPOSE: To report outcomes for pediatric posterior polar and posterior lentiglobus (lenticonus) cataracts. METHODS: All posterior polar and posterior lentiglobus cataracts operated by the senior author were identified by retrospective database review. Excluding one eye in bilateral cases, preoperative and intraoperative details were collected. All eyes were analyzed for preoperative biometry and surgical details; however, a minimum of 4 weeks of follow-up was required for analysis of visual function. RESULTS: Of 415 nontraumatic cataract cases with primary intraocular lens (IOL) implantation, 62 (15.0%) were identified with posterior polar (30/415, 7.3%) or posterior lentiglobus cataract (32/415, 7.7%). Twenty-eight (93%) posterior polar and all 32 posterior lentiglobus cases were monocular. Statistical comparison between the posterior polar and posterior lentiglobus groups for each of the following: age at time of surgery, preoperative axial length, lens thickness, and keratometry, showed no significant differences. IOL implantation was primarily in the capsular bag in both groups, 27/28 (96%) posterior polar and 25/32 (78%) posterior lentiglobus. Operative complications were rare. Twenty-five eyes in each group have follow-up greater than 4 weeks and were analyzed for visual function. A robust majority of patients in both groups, 21/25 (84%) posterior polar and 17/25 (68%) posterior lentiglobus cases, demonstrated postoperative visual acuity of 20/40 or better (or none to only a slight contralateral eye preference). Strabismus was infrequent in both groups pre- and postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: Posterior polar and posterior lentiglobus cataracts represent a large subset of nontraumatic cataracts in a pediatric cataract specialty practice. Visual outcomes are generally good. Complications are rare.
18029349	Statistical similarities between transcriptomics and quantitative shotgun proteomics data.	If the large collection of microarray-specific statistical tools was applicable to the analysis of quantitative shotgun proteomics datasets, it would certainly foster an important advancement of proteomics research. Here we analyze two large multidimensional protein identification technology datasets, one containing eight replicates of the soluble fraction of a yeast whole-cell lysate and one containing nine replicates of a human immunoprecipitate, to test whether normalized spectral abundance factor (NSAF) values share substantially similar statistical properties with transcript abundance values from Affymetrix GeneChip data. First we show similar dynamic range and distribution properties of these two types of numeric values. Next we show that the standard deviation (S.D.) of a protein's NSAF values was dependent on the average NSAF value of the protein itself, following a power law. This relationship can be modeled by a power law global error model (PLGEM), initially developed to describe the variance-versus-mean dependence that exists in GeneChip data. PLGEM parameters obtained from NSAF datasets proved to be surprisingly similar to the typical parameters observed in GeneChip datasets. The most important common feature identified by this approach was that, although in absolute terms the S.D. of replicated abundance values increases as a function of increasing average abundance, the coefficient of variation, a relative measure of variability, becomes progressively smaller under the same conditions. We next show that PLGEM parameters were reasonably stable to decreasing numbers of replicates. We finally illustrate one possible application of PLGEM in the identification of differentially abundant proteins that might potentially outperform standard statistical tests. In summary, we believe that this body of work lays the foundation for the application of microarray-specific tools in the analysis of NSAF datasets.
18029394	Intertester reliability and validity of motion assessments during lumbar spine accessory motion testing.	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Posterior-anterior (PA) assessment of the lumbar spine correlates with radiographic signs of instability and can guide treatment choices, yet studies of the validity of lumbar PA assessments have not been conducted in vivo. The purposes of this study were to determine the intertester reliability of the PA examination in assessing intersegmental lumbar spine motion and to evaluate the validity of this procedure in vivo with dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). SUBJECTS: Twenty-nine subjects with central lumbar pain participated in this study. METHODS: Two physical therapists independently identified each subject's most and least mobile lumbar segments using the PA procedure. Midsagittal lumbar images were obtained simultaneously during one examiner's assessment. Lumbar segmental mobility was quantified from magnetic resonance images as the change in the intervertebral angle between the resting position and the end range of the PA force application. For each vertebral level tested, maximal sagittal-plane segmental motion was determined. RESULTS: The intertester reliability for identifying the least mobile segment was good (agreement=82.8%, kappa=.71, 95% confidence interval [CI]=.48 to .94), but it was poor for identifying the most mobile segment (kappa=.29, 95% CI=-.13 to .71), despite good agreement (79.3%). The level of agreement between the PA assessments and intervertebral motion measured by MRI was poor (kappa=.04, 95% CI=-.16 to .24, and kappa=.00, 95% CI=-.09 to .08, for the least and most mobile segments, respectively). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Despite good intertester reliability for identifying the least mobile segment, PA assessments of lumbar segmental mobility did not agree with sagittal-plane motion measured by dynamic MRI. This finding calls into question the validity of the PA procedure for assessing intervertebral lumbar spine motion.
18030306	Differential opioid action on sensory and affective cerebral pain processing.	Low doses of morphine, the most commonly used opioid analgesic, have been shown to significantly reduce the affective but not the sensory intensive dimension of pain. This suggests differential dose-response relationships of opioid analgesia on the sensory and affective components of pain. We investigated the effects of different alfentanil plasma concentration levels (0, 19.6+/-2.7, 47.2+/-7.6, and 76.6+/-11.3 ng/ml) on pain-related brain activation achieved by short pulses of gaseous CO(2) delivered to the nasal mucosa, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) on a 3.0 T MRI scanner in 16 non-carriers and 9 homozygous carriers of the mu-opioid receptor gene variant OPRM1 118A>G. Increasing opioid concentrations had differential effects in brain regions processing the sensory and affective dimensions of pain. In brain regions associated with the processing of the sensory intensity of pain (primary and secondary somatosensory cortices, posterior insular cortex), activation decreased linearly in relation to alfentanil concentrations, which was significantly less pronounced in OPRM1 118G carriers. In contrast, in brain regions known to process the affective dimension of pain (parahippocampal gyrus, amygdala, anterior insula), pain-related activation disappeared at the lowest alfentanil dose, without genotype differences.
18030458	Human stance control beyond steady state response and inverted pendulum simplification.	Systems theory analyses have suggested that human upright stance can be modelled in terms of continuous multi-sensory feedback control. So far, these analyses have considered mainly steady-state responses to periodic stimuli and relied on a simplifying model of the body's mechanics in the form of an inverted pendulum. Therefore, they may have ignored relevant aspects of the postural behaviour. To prove a more general validity of a stance control model that we previously derived from such analyses, we now presented subjects with static-dynamic stimulus combinations and assessed response transients, anterior-posterior (a-p) response asymmetries, and possible deviations from the 'inverted pendulum' simplification (by measuring hip and knee bending). We presented normal subjects (Ns) and vestibular loss patients (Ps) with a-p support surface tilt on a motion platform under the instruction to maintain, with eyes closed, the body upright in space. In addition, subjects were to indicate perceived platform tilt with the help of pointers. We combined a fixed-amplitude sinusoidal tilt (0.1 Hz) with static tilts that were varied in amplitude and direction. We recorded upper body (shoulder) and lower body (hip) excursions in space and centre of pressure (COP) shift, and calculated the centre of mass (COM) angular excursion. We found that: (1) Immediately prior to stimulus onset (which was highly predictable), subjects showed a small anticipatory forward lean. (2) The subsequent transient response consisted of two parts. First, the body was moved along with the platform tilt and then, in the second part, the body excursion was braked by starting tilt compensation. Upon increasing tilt amplitude, the braking point showed a pronounced saturation with for-aft asymmetry. (3) During the following prolonged tilt, the tonic body excursions saturated with increasing static tilt amplitude. This saturation also showed a for-aft asymmetry (backwards saturation more pronounced). In contrast, the dynamic body excursions did not depend on the static tilt stimulus. (4) Tilt compensation occurred mainly in the ankle joints, but also involved small synergistic bendings in hips and knees in fixed register to the ankle rotation. (5) After the end of the stimulus, the body returned towards primary position, followed by a pronounced and slowly decaying tonic overshoot which was mainly related to tilt amplitude and initial tonic body excursion. (6) The responses of Ps qualitatively resembled those of Ns, apart from larger body excursions, less pronounced saturations, and less for-aft asymmetries. (7) Perceived platform tilt of Ns and Ps was correlated with their postural tilt compensations, but unlike the postural responses the perceptual responses overestimated actual static and dynamic tilt by a factor of 3-4. Our findings suggest two, so far undescribed and highly nonlinear mechanisms in human stance control. (a) The braking during the transient response appears to reflect a 'sensory reweighting switch' by which subjects change from a control that is referenced to the support to one that is referenced to space. (b) The saturation of the tonic body excursion also reflects a sensory reweighting mechanism; by this, subjects keep their balancing within a certain excursion limit. The two mechanisms were originally not predicted by our stance control model, but do not invalidate it, because they can simply be added to it. Also the observed for-aft asymmetries can be accounted for (by making thresholds in the two mechanisms asymmetric). In its extended form, the model mimics the previous and the new findings. We also conclude that the 'inverted pendulum' simplification is a legitimate simplification. We demonstrate the utility of the model by implementing it into a humanoid robot that then mimics closely the human experimental data. Finally, we present a hypothetical concept on sensory reweighting mechanisms in human stance control, which is meant to serve as a framework for future research.
18030597	Two trichodinid ectoparasites from marine molluscs in the Yellow Sea, off China, with the description of Trichodina caecellae n. sp. (Protozoa: Ciliophora: Peritrichia).	The morphology and infraciliature of two ectoparasitic ciliates, Trichodina caecellae n. sp. and T. ruditapicis Xu, Song & Warren, 2000, parasitising the gills of marine molluscs from the Shandong coast of the Yellow Sea, China, were investigated following wet silver nitrate and protargol impregnation. T. caecellae was found on the small marine sand clam Caecella chinensis Deshayes and is distinguished mainly by the acute triangle-like blade, the very delicate central part and the needle-shaped ray. T. ruditapicis was studied based on four populations from three clams: two populations from Ruditapes philippinarum (Adams) and one each from Saxidomus purpuratus (Sowerby) and Solen grandis Dunker. All four populations fell within the range of morphometry and agreed closely in the overall appearance of the adhesive disc. However, variability was found in the denticle structure, especially in populations from different host clams. Our observations suggest that denticle morphology may be more or less variable between and within populations, and that such minor differences should not be overestimated. It should be emphasised that, except for the denticle morphology, the bright granules or circles in the centre of the adhesive disc represent another important feature facilitating the identification of this trichodinid species.
18031221	Heat stress and public health: a critical review.	Heat is an environmental and occupational hazard. The prevention of deaths in the community caused by extreme high temperatures (heat waves) is now an issue of public health concern. The risk of heat-related mortality increases with natural aging, but persons with particular social and/or physical vulnerability are also at risk. Important differences in vulnerability exist between populations, depending on climate, culture, infrastructure (housing), and other factors. Public health measures include health promotion and heat wave warning systems, but the effectiveness of acute measures in response to heat waves has not yet been formally evaluated. Climate change will increase the frequency and the intensity of heat waves, and a range of measures, including improvements to housing, management of chronic diseases, and institutional care of the elderly and the vulnerable, will need to be developed to reduce health impacts.
18031304	Evolution of evolvability in a developmental model.	Evolvability, the ability of populations to adapt, can evolve through changes in the mechanisms determining genetic variation and in the processes of development. Here we construct and evolve a simple developmental model in which the pleiotropic effects of genes can evolve. We demonstrate that selection in a changing environment favors a specific pattern of variability, and that this favored pattern maximizes evolvability. Our analysis shows that mutant genotypes with higher evolvability are more likely to increase to fixation. We also show that populations of highly evolvable genotypes are much less likely to be invaded by mutants with lower evolvability, and that this dynamic primarily shapes evolvability. We examine several theoretical objections to the evolution of evolvability in light of this result. We also show that this result is robust to the presence or absence of recombination, and explore how nonrandom environmental change can select for a modular pattern of variability.
18031323	Differential responses of circulating amylin to high-fat vs. high-carbohydrate meal in healthy men.	OBJECTIVE: The success of an amylin analogue in weight loss trials has generated interest in amylin as a physiological satiety signal. Little is known about how plasma amylin responds to macronutrients. This study examined the effects of a high-carbohydrate meal (CHO), a high-fat meal (FAT) or a continued fast (FAST) on amylin concentrations and correlations among other satiety hormones and measures of appetite. DESIGN/PATIENTS: In a randomized, crossover design, 10 healthy males consumed a meal high in carbohydrate or fat or continued fasted. MEASUREMENTS: Blood samples and subjective hunger scores were obtained at baseline and 30, 90 and 210 min postprandial. RESULTS: After CHO, amylin, insulin and C-peptide were greater and des-acyl ghrelin lower compared to FAT (P < 0.001). Area under the curve (AUC) was greater for amylin and insulin and lower for des-acyl ghrelin following CHO. Subjective satiety and fullness were higher for CHO and FAT than FAST at 30 and 90 min but only for CHO at 210 min (P < 0.01). Hunger and desire to eat were lower for CHO and FAT than FAST at 30 and 90 min but only for CHO at 210 min (P < 0.005). Amylin was negatively correlated to hunger, desire to eat, and nausea and positively related to satiety and insulin. Des-acyl ghrelin was negatively associated with C-peptide, insulin and GLP-1 and satiety. CONCLUSIONS: CHO enhances amylin and suppresses des-acyl ghrelin to a greater extent than FAT in healthy men. The mechanisms responsible for these changes and their implications in the physiology of satiety remain to be elucidated.
18031748	Human fascioliasis and the presence of hybrid/introgressed forms of Fasciola hepatica and Fasciola gigantica in Vietnam.	The two species common of liver fluke, Fasciola hepatica and Fasciola gigantica, cause human fascioliasis. Hybrids between these species, and introgressed forms of Fasciola, are known from temperate and subtropical regions of eastern Asia. Here, we report the presence of hybrid and/or introgressed liver flukes in Vietnam where it has recently been recognised that human fascioliasis is an important zoonotic disease. Specimens examined came from domestic stock (cattle and buffalo) at slaughter and also from human patients. DNA sequences were obtained from the nuclear ribosomal second internal transcribed spacer (ITS-2) and from portions of two mitochondrial protein-coding genes. Mitochondrial sequences in every case were similar to those of Fasciola gigantica. Nuclear ITS-2 sequences belonged to one or other of the Fasciola species, or, sequences from both were found in the same individual worm. This study extends the known range of hybrids or introgressed forms of Fasciola into tropical regions of Asia.
18031865	Modelling assessment of regional groundwater contamination due to historic smelter emissions of heavy metals.	Historic emissions from ore smelters typically cause regional soil contamination. We developed a modelling approach to assess the impact of such contamination on groundwater and surface water load, coupling unsaturated zone leaching modelling with 3D groundwater transport modelling. Both historic and predictive modelling were performed, using a mass balance approach for three different catchments in the vicinity of three smelters. The catchments differ in their hydrology and geochemistry. The historic modelling results indicate that leaching to groundwater is spatially very heterogeneous due to variation in soil characteristics, in particular soil pH. In the saturated zone, cadmium is becoming strongly retarded due to strong sorption at neutral pH, even though the reactivity of the sandy sediments is low. A comparison between two datasets (from 1990 to 2002) on shallow groundwater and modelled concentrations provided a useful verification on the level of statistics of "homogeneous areas" (areas with comparable land use, soil type and geohydrological situation) instead of comparison at individual locations. While at individual locations observations and the model varies up to two orders of magnitude, for homogeneous areas, medians and ranges of measured concentrations and the model results are similar. A sensitivity analysis on metal input loads, groundwater composition and sediment geochemistry reveals that the best available information scenario based on the median value of input parameters for the model predicts the range in observed concentrations very well. However, the model results are sensitive to the sediment contents of the reactive components (organic matter, clay minerals and iron oxides). Uncertainty in metal input loads and groundwater chemistry are of lesser importance. Predictive modelling reveals a remarkable difference in geochemical and hydrological controls on subsurface metal transport at catchment-scale. Whether the surface water load will peak within a few decades or continue to increase until after 2050 depends on the dominant land use functions in the areas, their hydrology and geochemical build-up.
18031923	Complication rates of tension-free midurethral slings in the treatment of female stress urinary incontinence: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing tension-free midurethral tapes to other surgical procedures and different devices.	OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the complication rates of tension-free midurethral slings compared with other surgical treatments for stress urinary incontinence, including other tension-free midurethral slings. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science was performed in January 2007. Meta-analysis was conducted by using the Review Manager software 4.2. RESULTS: Our search identified 33 randomized controlled trials reporting data on complication rates. Our meta-analysis showed that complication rates were similar after tension-free vaginal tape (TVT) and Burch colposuspension, with the exclusion of bladder perforation, which was more common after TVT (p=0.0001), and reoperation rate, which was significantly higher after Burch colposuspension (p=0.02). TVT and pubovaginal sling were followed by similar complication rates. With regards to the comparisons among retropubic tapes, TVT and intravaginal slingplasty had similar complication rates, whereas suprapubic arc sling (SPARC) was complicated by higher rates of voiding lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) (p=0.02) and reoperations (p=0.04). Comparing retropubic and transobturator tapes, the occurrence of bladder perforations (p=0.007), pelvic haematoma (p=0.03), and storage LUTS (p=0.01) was significantly less common in patients treated by transobturator tapes. CONCLUSIONS: Tension-free slings were followed by lower risk of reoperation compared with Burch colposuspension, whereas pubovaginal sling and tension-free midurethral slings had similar complication rates. With regards to different tension-free tapes, voiding LUTS and reoperations were more common after SPARC, whereas bladder perforations, pelvic haematoma, and storage LUTS were less common after transobturator tapes. The quality of many evaluated studies was limited.
18031926	Dynamics of HIV infection studied with cellular automata and conformon-P systems.	Recently a cellular automaton (CA) has been used to model the dynamics of HIV infection, with interesting results. We replicate and further test this model, and we introduce an alternative model based on conformon-P (cP) systems. We find (in common with other recently published comments) that the CA model is very sensitive to initial conditions and produces appropriate qualitative dynamics only for a narrow range of rule probabilities. In contrast, the cP system model is robust to a wide range of conditions and parameters, with more reproducible qualitative agreement to the overall dynamics and to the densities of healthy and infected cells observed in vivo.
18031944	Induction of renoprotective gene expression by hypoxia-inducible transcription factor-1alpha ameliorates renal damage.	Hypoxia can cause not only acute kidney injury but also chronic kidney diseases. Hypoxia-inducible transcription factors activated by hypoxia play an important role in the cellular and tissular adaptation to low oxygen conditions. Hypoxia-inducible transcription factor-1 is composed of alpha and beta subunits. Hypoxia-inducible transcription factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) is known as a key regulator in protective role of renal damage by induction of downstream protective genes such as erythropoietin, heme oxygenase-1, vascular endothelial growth factor and glucose transporter-1. These proteins coded by protective genes are sufficient to induce renoprotection. So we hypothesize that recombinant adeno-associated viral HIF-1alpha gene will offer potential as a novel means to treat renal disease and can ameliorate renal damage efficiently by the injection of renal vein.
18031958	Phylogenetic analyses of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus isolates from Germany in 2006 and 2007 suggest at least three separate introductions of H5N1 virus.	In spring 2006, highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) of subtype H5N1 was detected in Germany in 343 dead wild birds, as well as in a black swan (Cygnus atratus) kept in a zoo, three stray cats, one stone marten (Martes foina), and in a single turkey farm. In 2007 (June-July) the virus reoccurred in 96 wild birds at six geographically separate locations in the Southeast of Germany. In addition, a backyard mixed duck and goose holding was affected. Real-time RT-PCR [Hoffmann, B., Harder, T., Starick, E., Depner, K., Werner, O., Beer, M., 2007. Rapid and highly sensitive pathotyping of avian influenza A H5N1 virus by using real-time reverse transcription-PCR. J. Clin. Microbiol. 45, 600-603] and nucleotide sequencing confirmed that these H5-viruses belonged to the Qinghai lineage of HPAIV H5N1 (clade 2.2). For a more detailed analysis, the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes of 27 selected German H5N1 viruses isolated 2006 or 2007 and originating from different regions and animal species were sequenced and analysed phylogenetically. As a result, three closely related but distinguishable H5N1 subclades could be defined: In 2006 a 'Northern type' (subclade 2.2.2), representing virus isolates from the German federal states Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Schleswig-Holstein, Brandenburg, and Lower Saxony, and a 'Southern type' (subclade 2.2.1) from Baden-Württemberg and Bavaria were detected. Interestingly, representatives of both types were present in Central Germany and caused the outbreak in turkeys (subclade 2.2.2) and in a case in a tufted duck (Aythya fuligula) (subclade 2.2.1) in Saxony. Furthermore, one isolate from the South of Germany was identified as 2.2.2 and vice versa a 2.2.1-like isolate was found in Northern Germany. H5N1 viruses isolated in 2007 belonged to a third type (subclade 2.2.3) which was not detected in 2006. Our data suggest the introduction of three distinct H5N1 variants into the wild bird population of Germany. The source of these viruses and the exact time of introduction remain obscure. Based on the identification of closely related H5N1 viruses from Southern and Central Russia, a recent introduction via wild birds on winter escape from these regions, early in 2006 constitutes the most likely scenario for the 2006 outbreaks. The viruses detected in 2007 most likely represent another new incursion from an as yet unknown source.
18032070	The tempo and mode of barnacle evolution.	Previous phylogenetic attempts at resolving barnacle evolutionary relationships are few and have relied on limited taxon sampling. Here we combine DNA sequences from three nuclear genes (18S, 28S and H3) and 44 morphological characters collected from 76 thoracican (ingroup) and 15 rhizocephalan (outgroup) species representing almost all the Thoracica families to assess the tempo and mode of barnacle evolution. Using phylogenetic methods of maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference and 14 fossil calibrations, we found that: (1) Iblomorpha form a monophyletic group; (2) pedunculated barnacles without shell plates (Heteralepadomorpha) are not ancestral, but have evolved, at least twice, from plated forms; (3) the ontogenetic pattern with 5-->6-->8-->12+ plates does not reflect Thoracica shell evolution; (4) the traditional asymmetric barnacles (Verrucidae) and the Balanomorpha are each monophyletic and together they form a monophyletic group; (5) asymmetry and loss of a peduncle have evolved twice in the Thoracica, resulting in neither the Verrucomorpha nor the Sessilia forming monophyletic groups in their present definitions; (6) the Scalpellomorpha are not monophyletic; (7) the Thoracica suborders evolved since the Early Carboniferous (340mya) with the final radiation of the Sessilia in the Upper Jurassic (147mya). These results, therefore, reject many of the underlying hypotheses about character evolution in the Cirripedia Thoracica, stimulate a variety of new thoughts on thoracican radiation, and suggest the need for a major rearrangement in thoracican classification based on estimated phylogenetic relationships.
18032071	Widespread occurrence and phylogenetic placement of a soil clone group adds a prominent new branch to the fungal tree of life.	Fungi are one of the most diverse groups of Eukarya and play essential roles in terrestrial ecosystems as decomposers, pathogens and mutualists. This study unifies disparate reports of unclassified fungal sequences from soils of diverse origins and anchors many of them in a well-supported clade of the Ascomycota equivalent to a subphylum. We refer to this clade as Soil Clone Group I (SCGI). We expand the breadth of environments surveyed and develop a taxon-specific primer to amplify 2.4kbp rDNA fragments directly from soil. Our results also expand the known range of this group from North America to Europe and Australia. The ancient origin of SCGI implies that it may represent an important transitional form among the basal Ascomycota groups. SCGI is unusual because it currently represents the only major fungal lineage known only from sequence data. This is an important contribution towards building a more complete fungal phylogeny and highlights the need for further work to determine the function and biology of SCGI taxa.
18032089	Posteroanterior movements in tender and less tender locations of the cervical spine.	In order to determine how posteroanterior movements (PAs) are related to tenderness and thus possibly symptom production, we measured PA movements to a force of 25N on each side of the cervical spines of asymptomatic subjects. From 10 subjects (six females and four males; mean age 37.2, range 21-50), 10 locations with a difference in tenderness to pressure between sides were used for analysis. The force-displacement and stiffness-force curves for tender and control sides were compared in four ways: simultaneous confidence bands (SCBs) for each side; width of SCBs for each side; SCBs of the difference between pairs of the tender and control curves; and simultaneous prediction bands (SPBs) from the tender side were compared to individual curves of the controls. The tender side demonstrated greater variation of both displacement and stiffness. The tender sides demonstrated greater within-subject stiffness for all force levels above 12N. All individual stiffness-force curves of the tender sides were significantly different from the control side. Expected differences in single measures of either displacement or stiffness were not detected. The results suggest that the pattern of stiffness is a more effective method of characterizing PA mobility than single measures used in previous studies.
18032385	Stearoyl-CoA desaturase 2 is required for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma expression and adipogenesis in cultured 3T3-L1 cells.	Based on recent evidence that fatty acid synthase and endogenously produced fatty acid derivatives are required for adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, we conducted a small interfering RNA-based screen to identify other fatty acid-metabolizing enzymes that may mediate this effect. Of 24 enzymes screened, stearoyl-CoA desaturase 2 (SCD2) was found to be uniquely and absolutely required for adipogenesis. Remarkably, SCD2 also controls the maintenance of adipocyte-specific gene expression in fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, including the expression of SCD1. Despite the high sequence similarity between SCD2 and SCD1, silencing of SCD1 did not down-regulate 3T3-L1 cell differentiation or gene expression. SCD2 mRNA expression was also uniquely elevated 44-fold in adipose tissue upon feeding mice a high fat diet, whereas SCD1 showed little response. The inhibition of adipogenesis caused by SCD2 depletion was associated with a decrease in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) mRNA and protein, whereas in mature adipocytes loss of SCD2 diminished PPARgamma protein levels, with little change in mRNA levels. In the latter case, SCD2 depletion did not change the degradation rate of PPARgamma protein but decreased the metabolic labeling of PPARgamma protein using [(35)S]methionine/cysteine, indicating protein translation was decreased. This requirement of SCD2 for optimal protein synthesis in fully differentiated adipocytes was verified by polysome profile analysis, where a shift in the mRNA to monosomes was apparent in response to SCD2 silencing. These results reveal that SCD2 is required for the induction and maintenance of PPARgamma protein levels and adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells.
18032431	GenoList: an integrated environment for comparative analysis of microbial genomes.	The multitude of bacterial genome sequences being determined has generated new requirements regarding the development of databases and graphical interfaces: these are needed to organize and retrieve biological information from the comparison of large sets of genomes. GenoList (http://genolist.pasteur.fr/GenoList) is an integrated environment dedicated to querying and analyzing genome data from bacterial species. GenoList inherits from the SubtiList database and web server, the reference data resource for the Bacillus subtilis genome. The data model was extended to hold information about relationships between genomes (e.g. protein families). The web user interface was designed to primarily take into account biologists' needs and modes of operation. Along with standard query and browsing capabilities, comparative genomics facilities are available, including subtractive proteome analysis. One key feature is the integration of the many tools accessible in the environment. As an example, it is straightforward to identify the genes that are specific to a group of bacteria, export them as a tab-separated list, get their protein sequences and run a multiple alignment on a subset of these sequences.
18032467	Metabolic rhythm abnormalities in mice lacking VIP-VPAC2 signaling.	The circadian pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) controls endogenous near 24-h physiological and behavioral rhythms in metabolism, neuroendocrine function, and locomotor activity. Recently, we showed that vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) and its receptor, VPAC(2) are critical to the intercellular communication between individual SCN neurons, and appropriate synchronization and phasing of these oscillatory cells. Mice defective in VIP signaling manifest grossly impaired circadian rhythms of SCN neuronal firing activity and are typically unable to maintain rhythmic wheel-running behavior in the absence of external time cues. Here we report that daily rhythms of metabolism and feeding behavior are also overtly altered in these animals. Under diurnal conditions (12:12-h light-dark; LD), metabolic and feeding rhythms are advanced in mice lacking either VIP or VPAC(2) receptor expression, peaking in the late day, rather than early night, as observed in wild-type mice. When placed in constant light (LL), both VIP-deficient and VPAC(2) receptor-knockout mice exhibit dampening of metabolic and feeding rhythms, which deteriorate after a few days. In addition, overall metabolic rate is greatly reduced in VPAC(2)-knockout mice, when compared with wild-type mice, regardless of lighting condition. The advancement of metabolic and feeding rhythms in these mice under LD suggests that these rhythms are less sensitive to masking by light. These results demonstrate that altering SCN function not only affects neuronal and wheel-running activity rhythms but also dramatically impairs temporal regulation of metabolism and feeding.
18032473	Maternal obesity at conception programs obesity in the offspring.	Risk of obesity in adult life is subject to programming during gestation. To examine whether in utero exposure to maternal obesity increases the risk of obesity in offspring, we developed an overfeeding-based model of maternal obesity in rats utilizing intragastric feeding of diets via total enteral nutrition. Feeding liquid diets to adult female rats at 220 kcal/kg(3/4) per day (15% excess calories/day) compared with 187 kcal/kg(3/4) per day for 3 wk caused substantial increase in body weight gain, adiposity, serum insulin, leptin, and insulin resistance. Lean or obese female rats were mated with ad libitum AIN-93G-fed male rats. Exposure to obesity was ensured to be limited only to the maternal in utero environment by cross-fostering pups to lean dams having ad libitum access to AIN-93G diets throughout lactation. Numbers of pups, birth weight, and size were not affected by maternal obesity. Male offspring from each group were weaned at postnatal day (PND)21 to either AIN-93G diets or high-fat diets (45% fat calories). Body weights of offspring from obese dams did not differ from offspring of lean dams when fed AIN-93G diets through PND130. However, offspring from obese dams gained remarkably greater (P < 0.005) body weight and higher % body fat when fed a high-fat diet. Body composition was assessed by NMR, X-ray computerized tomography, and weights of adipose tissues. Adipose histomorphometry, insulin sensitivity, and food intake were also assessed in the offspring. Our data suggest that maternal obesity at conception leads to fetal programming of offspring, which could result in obesity in later life.
18032492	Induction of heterosubtypic immunity to influenza virus by intranasal immunization.	Recovery from live influenza virus infection is known to induce heterosubtypic immunity. In contrast, immunity induced by inactivated vaccines is predominantly subtype specific. In this study, we investigated the heterosubtypic protective immunity induced by inactivated influenza virus. Intranasal immunization of mice with inactivated influenza virus A/PR8 (H1N1) provided complete protection against the homologous virus and a drift virus within the same subtype, A/WSN (H1N1), but not against the heterosubtypic virus A/Philippines (H3N2). However, coadministration of inactivated virus with cholera toxin as an adjuvant conferred complete heterosubtypic protection, without observed illness, even under conditions of CD4(+) or CD8(+) T-cell depletion. Analysis of immune correlates prior to challenge and postchallenge indicated that humoral immune responses with cross-neutralizing activity in lungs and in sera play a major role in conferring protective immunity against heterosubtypic challenge. This study has significant implications for developing broadly cross-reactive vaccines against newly emerging pathogenic influenza viruses.
18032617	Rapid preclinical detection of sheeppox virus by a real-time PCR assay.	Sheeppox virus (SPPV) is a member of the Capripoxvirus (CaPV) genus of the Poxviridae family. Members of this genus, which also include goatpox and lumpy skin disease viruses, cause economically significant disease in sheep, goats, and cattle. A rapid diagnostic assay for CaPV would be useful for disease surveillance as well as for detection of CaPV in clinical samples and for outbreak management. Here we describe a fluorogenic probe hydrolysis (TaqMan) PCR assay designed for rapid detection of CaPV and tested on sheep experimentally infected with a virulent strain of SPPV. This assay can detect SPPV in buffy coats, nasal swabs, oral swabs, scabs, and skin lesions as well as in lung and lymph nodes collected at necropsy. This single-tube diagnostic assay can be performed in 2 h or less and can detect viral DNA in preclinical, clinical, and postmortem samples.
18032918	BARgaining membranes for autophagosome formation: Regulation of autophagy and tumorigenesis by Bif-1/Endophilin B1.	Autophagy is an intracellular system for the bulk degradation of cytoplasmic components enclosed within double-membrane structures known as autophagosomes. To date, many autophagy-related (Atg) genes have been identified by independent genetic screens for autophagy-defective mutants in yeast; however, the molecular machinery required for the biogenesis of autophagosomes in mammalian systems has yet to be determined.(1,2) Recently, we have reported that Bif-1 interacts with Beclin 1 through UVRAG and promotes the activation of class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3KC3) and the formation of autophagosomes.(3) Moreover, we have found that loss of Bif-1 promotes starvation-induced caspase activation, but prolongs cell survival by suppressing autophagydependent cell death, and enhances spontaneous tumorigenesis in mice. Bif-1 is a member of the endophilin family, which possesses membrane binding and liposome tubulation activities.(4) During nutrient deprivation, Bif-1 accumulates in punctate foci where it co-localizes with LC3, Atg5 and Atg9. Time-lapse microscopy analyses reveal that Bif-1-positive small vesicles expand by recruiting and fusing with Atg9-positive small membranes to form autophagosomes. Taken together, our findings highlight Bif-1 as a potential regulator of autophagosome biogenesis and as a tumor suppressor.
18033235	Alpha6-containing nicotinic acetylcholine receptors dominate the nicotine control of dopamine neurotransmission in nucleus accumbens.	Modulation of striatal dopamine (DA) neurotransmission plays a fundamental role in the reinforcing and ultimately addictive effects of nicotine. Nicotine, by desensitizing beta2 subunit-containing (beta2*) nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) on striatal DA axons, significantly enhances how DA is released by reward-related burst activity compared to nonreward-related tonic activity. This action provides a synaptic mechanism for nicotine to facilitate the DA-dependent reinforcement. The subfamily of beta2*-nAChRs responsible for these potent synaptic effects could offer a molecular target for therapeutic strategies in nicotine addiction. We explored the role of alpha6beta2*-nAChRs in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and caudate-putamen (CPu) by observing action potential-dependent DA release from synapses in real-time using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry at carbon-fiber microelectrodes in mouse striatal slices. The alpha6-specific antagonist alpha-conotoxin-MII suppressed DA release evoked by single and low-frequency action potentials and concurrently enhanced release by high-frequency bursts in a manner similar to the beta2*-selective antagonist dihydro-beta-erythroidine (DHbetaE) in NAc, but less so in CPu. The greater role for alpha6*-nAChRs in NAc was not due to any confounding regional difference in ACh tone since elevated ACh levels (after the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor ambenonium) had similar outcomes in NAc and CPu. Rather, there appear to be underlying differences in nAChR subtype function in NAc and CPu. In summary, we reveal that alpha6beta2*-nAChRs dominate the effects of nicotine on DA release in NAc, whereas in CPu their role is minor alongside other beta2*-nAChRs (eg alpha4*), These data offer new insights to suggest striatal alpha6*-nAChRs as a molecular target for a therapeutic strategy for nicotine addiction.
18033685	Colorectal cancer screening: a comparison of 35 initiatives in 17 countries.	Although in its infancy, organized screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) in the general population is increasing at regional and national levels. Documenting and describing these initiatives is critical to identifying, sharing and promoting best practice in the delivery of CRC screening. Subsequently, the International Colorectal Cancer Screening Network (ICRCSN) was established in 2003 to promote best practice in the delivery of organized screening programs. The initial aim was to identify and document organized screening initiatives that commenced before May 2004. Each identified initiative was sent 1 questionnaire per screening modality: fecal occult blood test, flexible sigmoidoscopy or total colonoscopy. Information was collected on screening methodology, testing details and initiative status. In total, 35 organized initiatives were identified in 17 countries, including 10 routine population-based screening programs, 9 pilots and 16 research projects. Fecal occult blood tests were the most frequently used screening modality, and total colonoscopy was seldom used as a primary screening test. The eligible age for screening ranged from 40 years old to no upper limit; most initiatives included participants aged 50 to 64. Recruitment was usually done by a mailed invitation or during a visit to a family physician. In conclusion, this is the first investigation describing the delivery of CRC screening protocols to various populations. The work of the ICRCSN is enabling valuable information to be shared and a common nomenclature to be established.
18033744	Statistical data processing in clinical proteomics.	This review discusses data analysis strategies for the discovery of biomarkers in clinical proteomics. Proteomics studies produce large amounts of data, characterized by few samples of which many variables are measured. A wealth of classification methods exists for extracting information from the data. Feature selection plays an important role in reducing the dimensionality of the data prior to classification and in discovering biomarker leads. The question which classification strategy works best is yet unanswered. Validation is a crucial step for biomarker leads towards clinical use. Here we only discuss statistical validation, recognizing that biological and clinical validation is of utmost importance. First, there is the need for validated model selection to develop a generalized classifier that predicts new samples correctly. A cross-validation loop that is wrapped around the model development procedure assesses the performance using unseen data. The significance of the model should be tested; we use permutations of the data for comparison with uninformative data. This procedure also tests the correctness of the performance validation. Preferably, a new set of samples is measured to test the classifier and rule out results specific for a machine, analyst, laboratory or the first set of samples. This is not yet standard practice. We present a modular framework that combines feature selection, classification, biomarker discovery and statistical validation; these data analysis aspects are all discussed in this review. The feature selection, classification and biomarker discovery modules can be incorporated or omitted to the preference of the researcher. The validation modules, however, should not be optional. In each module, the researcher can select from a wide range of methods, since there is not one unique way that leads to the correct model and proper validation. We discuss many possibilities for feature selection, classification and biomarker discovery. For validation we advice a combination of cross-validation and permutation testing, a validation strategy supported in the literature.
18033794	Analysis of a Gibbs sampler method for model-based clustering of gene expression data.	MOTIVATION: Over the last decade, a large variety of clustering algorithms have been developed to detect coregulatory relationships among genes from microarray gene expression data. Model-based clustering approaches have emerged as statistically well-grounded methods, but the properties of these algorithms when applied to large-scale data sets are not always well understood. An in-depth analysis can reveal important insights about the performance of the algorithm, the expected quality of the output clusters, and the possibilities for extracting more relevant information out of a particular data set. RESULTS: We have extended an existing algorithm for model-based clustering of genes to simultaneously cluster genes and conditions, and used three large compendia of gene expression data for Saccharomyces cerevisiae to analyze its properties. The algorithm uses a Bayesian approach and a Gibbs sampling procedure to iteratively update the cluster assignment of each gene and condition. For large-scale data sets, the posterior distribution is strongly peaked on a limited number of equiprobable clusterings. A GO annotation analysis shows that these local maxima are all biologically equally significant, and that simultaneously clustering genes and conditions performs better than only clustering genes and assuming independent conditions. A collection of distinct equivalent clusterings can be summarized as a weighted graph on the set of genes, from which we extract fuzzy, overlapping clusters using a graph spectral method. The cores of these fuzzy clusters contain tight sets of strongly coexpressed genes, while the overlaps exhibit relations between genes showing only partial coexpression.

18033795	Improved recognition of figures containing fluorescence microscope images in online journal articles using graphical models.	MOTIVATION: There is extensive interest in automating the collection, organization and analysis of biological data. Data in the form of images in online literature present special challenges for such efforts. The first steps in understanding the contents of a figure are decomposing it into panels and determining the type of each panel. In biological literature, panel types include many kinds of images collected by different techniques, such as photographs of gels or images from microscopes. We have previously described the SLIF system (http://slif.cbi.cmu.edu) that identifies panels containing fluorescence microscope images among figures in online journal articles as a prelude to further analysis of the subcellular patterns in such images. This system contains a pretrained classifier that uses image features to assign a type (class) to each separate panel. However, the types of panels in a figure are often correlated, so that we can consider the class of a panel to be dependent not only on its own features but also on the types of the other panels in a figure. RESULTS: In this article, we introduce the use of a type of probabilistic graphical model, a factor graph, to represent the structured information about the images in a figure, and permit more robust and accurate inference about their types. We obtain significant improvement over results for considering panels separately. AVAILABILITY: The code and data used for the experiments described here are available from http://murphylab.web.cmu.edu/software.
18034365	Transcriptional activation of Cor/Lea genes and increase in abiotic stress tolerance through expression of a wheat DREB2 homolog in transgenic tobacco.	Wdreb2, previously isolated as a DREB2 homolog, is expressed in wheat seedlings under abiotic stresses, such as cold, drought, and high salinity, and following treatment with exogenous ABA. In the present study, we generated transgenic tobacco plants expressing Wdreb2 to clarify roles of Wdreb2 in stress tolerance and the direct trans-activation of Cor/Lea genes by WDREB2. Wdreb2 expression significantly improved freezing and osmotic stress tolerance in tobacco plants. Several putative stress- and ABA-responsive cis-elements were found in the 5' upstream regions of four wheat Cor/Lea genes, Wdhn13, Wrab17, Wrab18, and Wrab19. The expression level of a gusA reporter gene under control of Cor/Lea promoter sequences was enhanced by cold, drought and ABA treatment in transgenic tobacco plants. Moreover, the gusA expression level was markedly enhanced by Wdreb2 expression under nonstressful conditions. These results clearly indicate that WDREB2 acts as a transcription factor and positively regulates Wdhn13, Wrab17, Wrab18, and Wrab19 in the development of multiple abiotic stress tolerance in wheat.
18034387	Harm reduction programmes in the Asia--Pacific Region.	INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: This paper reports on the public health intervention of harm reduction to address drug use issues in the Asia-Pacific region. DESIGN AND METHODS: It is based on the report 'Situational analysis of illicit drug issues and responses in Asia and the Pacific', commissioned by the Australian National Council on Drugs Asia Pacific Drug Issues Committee. A comprehensive desk-based review based on published and unpublished literature and key informant data. RESULTS: Drug use in the Asia--Pacific region is widespread, resulting in serious adverse health consequences. Needle and syringe programmes are found in some parts of Asia, but not in the six Pacific Island countries reviewed. Outreach and peer education programmes are implemented, but overall appear minor in size and scope. Substitution therapy programmes appear to be entering a new era of acceptance in some parts of Asia. Primary health care specifically for drug users overall is limited. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Harm reduction programmes in the Asia--Pacific region are either small in scale or do not exist. Most programmes lack the technical capacity, human resources and a limited scope of operations to respond effectively to the needs of drug users. Governments in this region should be encouraged to endorse evidence-based harm reduction programmes.
18034813	Burnout and its correlates among nursing staff: questionnaire survey.	AIM: This paper is a report of a study to determine the burnout level and its correlates in nurses. BACKGROUND: Healthcare providers and especially nurses are generally considered a high risk group regarding work stress and burnout and this syndrome has been a major concern in the field of occupational health. METHOD: The study was carried out at a university hospital in Turkey during May-June 2005. A total of 418 nurses from the 474 working at the hospital at the time (88.2%) answered a self-administered questionnaire including the Maslach Burnout Inventory. FINDINGS: All the nurses were female, with a mean age of 30.6 (5.4) and a median age of 29 years. The mean score was 17.99(6.35) for the Emotional Exhaustion subscale, 5.72 (3.87) for the Depersonalization subscale and 19.83 (4.66) for the Personal Accomplishment subscale. Emotional Exhaustion decreased with increasing age (P < 0.05). Total time in the job, weekly working hours, shift-working and the unit where employed influenced burnout scores (P < 0.05). Not being happy with relations with superiors, not finding the job suitable, feeling anxious about the future, perceived poor health, problems with personal life and financial difficulties were also factors influencing burnout scale scores (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: It is necessary to consider nurses having the characteristics shown as the correlates of burnout in this study as a target group, to screen periodically the burnout status and improve their working conditions, especially relationships with colleagues.
18034855	Protein crystallography for non-crystallographers, or how to get the best (but not more) from published macromolecular structures.	The number of macromolecular structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank now exceeds 45,000, with the vast majority determined using crystallographic methods. Thousands of studies describing such structures have been published in the scientific literature, and 14 Nobel prizes in chemistry or medicine have been awarded to protein crystallographers. As important as these structures are for understanding the processes that take place in living organisms and also for practical applications such as drug design, many non-crystallographers still have problems with critical evaluation of the structural literature data. This review attempts to provide a brief outline of technical aspects of crystallography and to explain the meaning of some parameters that should be evaluated by users of macromolecular structures in order to interpret, but not over-interpret, the information present in the coordinate files and in their description. A discussion of the extent of the information that can be gleaned from the coordinates of structures solved at different resolution, as well as problems and pitfalls encountered in structure determination and interpretation are also covered.
18035414	Prognostic significance of ATM and TP53 deletions in Chinese patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.	Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common adult form of leukemia in the Western world, however, infrequent in the Eastern. It shows a remarkable heterogeneity, with some patients having an almost normal lifespan, others surviving only several years after diagnosis despite intensive therapy. To prospectively explore the prognostic significance of ATM and TP53 deletions in Chinese patients with CLL, interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and probes of LSI ATM and LSI p53 were used to detect ATM and TP53 deletions in 95 patients with CLL. ATM and TP53 deletions and their association with some other prognostic factors such as Binet stage, lymphocyte count in peripheral blood, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), beta2-microglobulin (beta2-MG), CD38 and ZAP-70 expressions were analyzed. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to construct survival curves, and results were compared using the log-rank test. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to assess associations between survival time and potential risk factors. Out of the 95 patients with CLL, ATM gene deletion was found in 9 (9.5%) patients, TP53 gene deletion in 16 (16.8%) cases. There were no significant differences between ATM or TP53 deletion and clinical parameters of sex, age, Binet stage, lymphocyte count, LDH, beta2-MG or ZAP-70 expression. However, the frequency of ATM and TP53 deletions were obviously higher in CD38-positive group than in CD38-negative group (P=0.001 and P=0.047, respectively). Among 41 patients received treatment with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, there were nine patients with TP53 or ATM deletion, and no patient with these cytogenetic abnormalities achieved complete response (CR). Survival analysis showed that the patients with TP53 deletion had significantly shorter survival times than the patients without TP53 deletion. There was no evidence of important association between outcome and ATM gene deletion. Serum levels of LDH and beta2-MG, CD38 expression, and TP53 deletion were the significant factors in determining overall survival (OS). TP53 deletion and CD38 expression were the variables strongly associated with OS by multivariate Cox regression analysis. It was showed that ATM or TP53 deletion is associated with high expression level of CD38 and TP53 deletion as a possible prognostic factor in Chinese patients with CLL.
18036147	Orthotopic transplantation of immortalized mesencephalic progenitors (CSM14.1 cells) into the substantia nigra of hemiparkinsonian rats induces neuronal differentiation and motoric improvement.	Neural progenitor cell grafting is a promising therapeutic option in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. In previous experiments we grafted temperature-sensitive immortalized CSM14.1 cells, derived from the ventral mesencephalon of E14-rats, bilaterally in the caudate putamen of adult hemiparkinsonian rats. In these studies we were not able to demonstrate either a therapeutic improvement or neuronal differentiation of transplanted cells. Here we examined whether CSM14.1 cells grafted bilaterally orthotopically in the substantia nigra of hemiparkinsonian rats have the potential to differentiate into dopaminergic neurons. Adult male rats received 6-hydroxydopamine into the right medial forebrain bundle, and successful lesions were evaluated with apomorphine-induced rotations 12 days after surgery. Two weeks after a successful lesion the animals received bilateral intranigral grafts consisting of either about 50 000 PKH26-labelled undifferentiated CSM14.1 cells (n = 16) or a sham-graft (n = 9). Rotations were evaluated 3, 6, 9 and 12 weeks post-grafting. Animals were finally perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde. Cryoprotected brain slices were prepared for immunohistochemistry using the freeze-thaw technique to preserve PKH26-labelling. Slices were immunostained against neuronal epitopes (NeuN, tyrosine hydroxylase) or glial fibrillary acidic protein. The CSM14.1-cell grafts significantly reduced the apomorphine-induced rotations 12 weeks post-grafting compared to the sham-grafts (P < 0.05). There was an extensive mediolateral migration (400-700 microm) of the PKH26-labelled cells within the host substantia nigra. Colocalization with NeuN or glial fibrillary acidic protein in transplanted cells was confirmed with confocal microscopy. No tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive grafted cells were detectable. The therapeutic effect of the CSM14.1 cells could be explained either by their glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor-expression or their neural differentiation with positive effects on the basal ganglia neuronal networks.
18036525	A new approach to chromosomal abnormalities in sperm from patients with oligoasthenoteratozoospermia: detection of double aneuploidy in addition to single aneuploidy and diploidy by five-color fluorescence in situ hybridization using one probe set.	OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequencies of disomy, nullisomy, total aneuploidy, and diploidy in the sperms of infertile men. DESIGN: A controlled prospective study. SETTING: Assisted reproductive technology (ART)/IVF Unit and Department of Medical Biology and Genetics, Meram Medical Faculty, Konya, Turkey. PATIENT(S): Infertile men with oligoasthenoteratozoospermia (OAT) and normal fertile donors. INTERVENTION(S): After slide preparation from semen samples, sperm nuclei were analyzed for chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X, and Y by five-color fluorescence in situ hybridization. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The sperm aneuploidy (disomy and nullisomy) and diploidy rates were determined according to the number of signals detected for each probe in infertile and fertile men. RESULTS: Patients with OAT had a significantly higher incidence of disomy (except chromosome 18 and XX disomy), nullisomy (except chromosome 18), and diploidy than normal fertile controls. In addition to double disomy, double nullisomy and disomy+nullisomy were observed in patients with OAT, but none of these were seen in controls. CONCLUSION(S): In this study patients with OAT had an increased rate of sperm aneuploidy and diploidy. This finding suggest that patients with OAT may be at an increased risk of producing aneuploid and triploid offsprings. For this reason, it may be very important to perform the sperm fluorescence in situ hybridization in patients with OAT. Thus, a more informative genetic counseling might be given to couples with male factor infertility who are at an increased risk of having aneuploid offsprings and triploid conceptions before intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).
18036718	Detailed molecular characterization of cord blood-derived endothelial progenitors.	OBJECTIVE: Given their involvement in pathological and physiological angiogenesis, there has been growing interest in understanding and manipulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) for therapeutic purposes. However, detailed molecular analysis of EPC before and during endothelial differentiation is lacking and is the subject of the present study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We report a detailed microarray gene-expression profile of freshly isolated (day 0) human cord blood (CB)-derived EPC (CD133+KDR+ or CD34+KDR+), and at different time points during in vitro differentiation (early: day 13; late: day 27). RESULTS: Data obtained reflect an EPC transcriptome enriched in genes related to stem/progenitor cells properties (chromatin remodeling, self-renewal, signaling, cytoskeleton organization and biogenesis, recruitment, and adhesion). Using a complementary DNA microarray enriched in intronic transcribed sequences, we observed, as well, that naturally transcribed intronic noncoding RNAs were specifically expressed at the EPC stage. CONCLUSION: Taken together, we have defined the global gene-expression profile of CB-derived EPC during the process of endothelial differentiation, which can be used to identify genes involved in different vascular pathologies.
18036730	Nephron-sparing surgery versus radical nephrectomy in the treatment of intracapsular renal cell carcinoma up to 7cm.	OBJECTIVE: To compare the oncologic outcomes of nephron-sparing surgery versus radical nephrectomy in intracapsular renal cell carcinoma (RCC) up to 7 cm by reviewing surgical experience retrospectively. METHODS: Data from 1290 consecutive patients who had surgery for RCC have been stored in a dedicated database since 1983. We selected and reviewed those related to disease-free patients who had been treated for unilateral pT1a/pT1b pN0/Nx M0 carcinomas up to 7 cm and later followed for a minimum of 12 mo. RESULTS: A total of 642 patients with mean follow-up of 72.9 mo were selected; 313 had been treated for tumours <4 cm in diameter (176 nephron-sparing surgery, 137 nephrectomy), whereas 329 had been treated for tumours measuring > or =4 cm (52 nephron-sparing surgery, 277 nephrectomy). The comparison between tumours <4 cm or > or =4 cm in diameter showed worse progression and disease-free survival rates for the latter, but the type of surgery (nephron-sparing or radical) seemed to have no significant impact. CONCLUSIONS: Conservative management can be cautiously suggested for RCC up to 7 cm because the worsening of prognosis as diameter increases shows no statistical differences for either nephron-sparing or radical surgery. The agreement of our results with those of similar studies available in the literature may suggest designing a prospective study to compare conservative and more radical surgery in the management of RCC up to 7 cm.
18037175	Potential of sponges and microalgae for marine biotechnology.	Marine organisms can be used to produce several novel products that have applications in new medical technologies, in food and feed ingredients and as biofuels. In this paper two examples are described: the development of marine drugs from sponges and the use of microalgae to produce bulk chemicals and biofuels. Many sponges produce bioactive compounds with important potential applications as medical drugs. Recent developments in metagenomics, in the culturing of associated microorganisms from sponges and in the development of sponge cell-lines have the potential to solve the issue of supply, which is the main limitation for sponge exploitation. For the production of microalgal products at larger scales and the production of biofuels, major technological breakthroughs need to be realized to increase the product yield.
18037271	Medical image retrieval with probabilistic multi-class support vector machine classifiers and adaptive similarity fusion.	We present a content-based image retrieval framework for diverse collections of medical images of different modalities, anatomical regions, acquisition views, and biological systems. For the image representation, the probabilistic output from multi-class support vector machines (SVMs) with low-level features as inputs are represented as a vector of confidence or membership scores of pre-defined image categories. The outputs are combined for feature-level fusion and retrieval based on the combination rules that are derived by following Bayes' theorem. We also propose an adaptive similarity fusion approach based on a linear combination of individual feature level similarities. The feature weights are calculated by considering both the precision and the rank order information of top retrieved relevant images as predicted by SVMs. The weights are dynamically updated by the system for each individual search to produce effective results. The experiments and analysis of the results are based on a diverse medical image collection of 11,000 images of 116 categories. The performances of the classification and retrieval algorithms are evaluated both in terms of error rate and precision-recall. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework as compared to the commonly used approaches based on low-level feature descriptors.
18037315	In silico screening against wild-type and mutant Plasmodium falciparum dihydrofolate reductase.	Modeling studies were performed on known inhibitors of wild-type as well as quadruple mutant Plasmodium falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). GOLD was used to dock 31 pyrimethamine derivatives into the active site of DHFR obtained from the X-ray crystal structures 1J3I.pdb and 1J3K.pdb. Predicted binding affinities from a scoring function were analyzed and evaluated in order to develop criteria for selecting compounds having a greater chance of activity versus wild-type and resistant strains of P. falciparum for future high-throughput screening experiments.
18037437	Actin hydrophobic loop 262-274 and filament nucleation and elongation.	The importance of actin hydrophobic loop 262-274 dynamics to actin polymerization and filament stability has been shown recently with the use of the yeast mutant actin L180C/L269C/C374A, in which the hydrophobic loop could be locked in a "parked" conformation by a disulfide bond between C180 and C269. Such a cross-linked globular actin monomer does not form filaments, suggesting nucleation and/or elongation inhibition. To determine the role of loop dynamics in filament nucleation and/or elongation, we studied the polymerization of the cross-linked actin in the presence of cofilin, to assist with actin nucleation, and with phalloidin, to stabilize the elongating filament segments. We demonstrate here that together, but not individually, phalloidin and cofilin co-rescue the polymerization of cross-linked actin. The polymerization was also rescued by filament seeds added together with phalloidin but not with cofilin. Thus, loop immobilization via cross-linking inhibits both filament nucleation and elongation. Nevertheless, the conformational changes needed to catalyze ATP hydrolysis by actin occur in the cross-linked actin. When actin filaments are fully decorated by cofilin, the helical twist of filamentous actin (F-actin) changes by approximately 5 degrees per subunit. Electron microscopic analysis of filaments rescued by cofilin and phalloidin revealed a dense contact between opposite strands in F-actin and a change of twist by approximately 1 degrees per subunit, indicating either partial or disordered attachment of cofilin to F-actin and/or competition between cofilin and phalloidin to alter F-actin symmetry. Our findings show an importance of the hydrophobic loop conformational dynamics in both actin nucleation and elongation and reveal that the inhibition of these two steps in the cross-linked actin can be relieved by appropriate factors.
18037519	MOSFET detectors in quality assurance of tomotherapy treatments.	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of this work was to characterize metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) in a 6 MV conventional linac and investigate their use for quality assurance of radiotherapy treatments with a tomotherapy Hi-Art unit. MATERIALS AND METHODS: High sensitivity and standard sensitivity MOSFETs were first calibrated and then tested for reproducibility, field size dependence, and accuracy of measuring surface dose in a 6 MV beam as well as in a tomotherapy Hi-Art unit. In vivo measurements were performed on both a RANDO phantom and several head and neck cancer patients treated with tomotherapy and compared to TLD measurements and treatment plan doses to evaluate the performance of MOSFETs in a high gradient radiation field. RESULTS: The average calibration factor found was 0.345+/-2.5%cGy/mV for the high sensitivity MOSFETs tested and 0.901+/-2.4%cGy/mV for the standard sensitivity MOSFETs. MOSFET measured surface doses had an average agreement with ion chamber measurements of 1.55% for the high sensitivity MOSFET and 5.23% for the standard sensitivity MOSFET when averaged over all trials and field sizes tested. No significant dependence on field size was found for the standard sensitivity MOSFETs, however a maximum difference of 5.34% was found for the high sensitivity MOSFET calibration factors in the field sizes tested. Measurements made with MOSFETS on head and neck patients treated on a tomotherapy Hi-Art unit had an average agreement of (3.26+/-0.03)% with TLD measurements, however the average of the absolute difference between the MOSFET measurements and the treatment plan skin doses was (12.2+/-7.5)%. The MOSFET measured patient skin doses also had good reproducibility, with inter-fraction deviations ranging from 1.4% to 6.6%. Similar results were found from trials using a RANDO phantom. CONCLUSIONS: The MOSFETs performed well when used in the tomotherapy Hi-Art unit and did not increase the overall treatment set-up time when used for patient measurements. It was found that MOSFETs are suitable detectors for surface dose measurements in both conventional beam and tomotherapy treatments and they can provide valuable skin dose information in areas where the treatment planning system may not be accurate.
18037546	Influence of trunk flexion on hip and knee joint kinematics during a controlled drop landing.	BACKGROUND: An erect posture and greater knee valgus during landing have been implicated as anterior cruciate ligament injury risk factors. While previous research suggests coupling of knee and hip kinematics, the influence of trunk positioning on lower extremity kinematics has yet to be determined. We hypothesized that greater trunk flexion during landing would result in greater knee and hip flexion and lesser knee valgus. Identification of a modifiable factor (e.g. trunk flexion) which positively influences kinematics of multiple lower extremity joints would be invaluable for anterior cruciate ligament injury prevention efforts. METHODS: Forty healthy individuals completed two drop landing tasks while knee, hip, and trunk kinematics were sampled. The first task constituted the natural/preferred landing strategy (Preferred), while in the second task, subjects actively flexed the trunk upon landing (Flexed). FINDINGS: Peak trunk flexion angle was 47 degrees greater for Flexed compared to Preferred (P<0.001), and was associated with increases in peak hip flexion angle of 31 degrees (P<0.001) and peak knee flexion angle of 22 degrees (P<0.001). INTERPRETATION: Active trunk flexion during landing produces concomitant increases in knee and hip flexion angles. A more flexed/less erect posture during landing is associated with a reduced anterior cruciate ligament injury risk. As such, incorporating greater trunk flexion as an integral component of anterior cruciate ligament injury prevention programs may be warranted.
18037579	Variability of four-dimensional computed tomography patient models.	PURPOSE: To quantify the interfractional variability in lung tumor trajectory and mean position during the course of radiation therapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Repeat four-dimensional (4D) cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans (median, nine scans/patient) routinely acquired during the course of treatment were analyzed for 56 patients with lung cancer. Tumor motion was assessed by using local rigid registration of a region of interest in the 3D planning CT to each phase in the 4D CBCT. Displacements of the mean tumor position relative to the planned position (baseline variations) were obtained by using time-weighted averaging of the motion curve. RESULTS: The tumor trajectory shape was found to be stable interfractionally, with mean variability not exceeding 1 mm (1 SD) in each direction for the inhale and exhale phases. Interfractional baseline variations, however, were large, with 1.6- (left-right), 3.9- (cranial-caudal), and 2.8-mm (anterior-posterior) systematic variations (1 SD) and 1.2- (left-right), 2.4- (cranial-caudal) and 2.2-mm (anterior-posterior) random variations. Eliminating baseline variations by using soft-tissue guidance decreases planning target volume margins by approximately 50% compared with bony anatomy-driven protocols for conventional fractionation schemes. CONCLUSIONS: Systematic and random baseline variations constitute a substantial portion of the geometric variability present in the treatment of patients with lung cancer and require generous safety margins when relying on accurate setup/immobilization or bony anatomy-driven correction strategies. The 4D-CBCT has the ability to accurately monitor tumor trajectory shape and baseline variations and drive image-guided correction strategies that allows safe margin reduction.
18037669	Sperm aneuploidy and meiotic sex chromosome configurations in an infertile XYY male.	BACKGROUND: There is little information regarding the behaviour of the extra Y chromosome during meiosis I in men with 47,XYY karyotypes and the segregation of the sex chromosomes in sperm. We applied immunofluorescent and FISH techniques to study the relationship between the sex chromosome configuration in meiotic germ cells and the segregation pattern in sperm, both isolated from semen samples of a 47,XYY infertile man. METHODS: The sex chromosome configuration of pachytene germ cells was determined by immunostaining pachytene nuclei for synaptonemal complex protein 3 (SCP3) and SCP1. FISH was subsequently performed to identify the sex chromosomes and chromosome 18 in pachytene cells. Dual- and triple-color FISH was performed on sperm to analyse aneuploidy for chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X, and Y. RESULTS: 46,XY/47,XYY mosaic pachytene cells were observed (22.2% vs. 77.8%, respectively). The XYY trivalent, and X+YY configurations were most common. While the majority of sperm were of normal chromosomal constitution, an increase in sex and autosome disomy was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The level of germ cell moscaicism and their meiotic sex chromosome configurations may determine sperm aneuploidy rate and fertility status in 47,XYY men. Our approach of immunostaining meiotic cells in the ejaculate is a novel method for investigating spermatogenesis in infertile men.
18037682	Probabilistic path ranking based on adjacent pairwise coexpression for metabolic transcripts analysis.	MOTIVATION: Pathway knowledge in public databases enables us to examine how individual metabolites are connected via chemical reactions and what genes are implicated in those processes. For two given (sets of) compounds, the number of possible paths between them in a metabolic network can be intractably large. It would be informative to rank these paths in order to differentiate between them. RESULTS: Focusing on adjacent pairwise coexpression, we developed an algorithm which, for a specified k, efficiently outputs the top k paths based on a probabilistic scoring mechanism, using a given metabolic network and microarray datasets. Our idea of using adjacent pairwise coexpression is supported by recent studies that local coregulation is predominant in metabolism. We first evaluated this idea by examining to what extent highly correlated gene pairs are adjacent and how often they are consecutive in a metabolic network. We then applied our algorithm to two examples of path ranking: the paths from glucose to pyruvate in the entire metabolic network of yeast and the paths from phenylalanine to sinapyl alcohol in monolignols pathways of arabidopsis under several different microarray conditions, to confirm and discuss the performance analysis of our method.
18039130	The aging brain.	Aging is accompanied by cognitive decline in a major segment of the population and is the primary risk factor for Alzheimer's disease and other prevalent neurodegenerative disorders. Despite this central role in disease pathogenesis and morbidity, the aging of the brain has not been well understood at a molecular level. This review seeks to integrate what is known about age-related cognitive and neuroanatomical changes with recent advances in understanding basic molecular mechanisms that underlie aging. An important issue is how normal brain aging transitions to pathological aging, giving rise to neurodegenerative disorders. Toxic protein aggregates have been identified as potential contributory factors, including amyloid beta-protein in Alzheimer's disease, tau in frontotemporal dementia, and alpha-synuclein in Parkinson's disease. However, current models of pathogenesis do not explain the origin of the common sporadic forms of these diseases or address the critical nexus between aging and disease. This review discusses potential approaches to unifying the systems biology of the aging brain with the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration.
18039142	Applications of proteomics to lab diagnosis.	Detailed and comprehensive characterization of proteins is a major goal of proteomics. This goal has become more realistic today with the latest high-resolution mass spectrometers capable of faster sequencing in a high-throughput fashion and with the emergence of new techniques such as protein and peptide microarrays. A promising area for discovery is the application of these advanced mass spectrometric and other quantitative proteomic methodologies to laboratory diagnosis. This review focuses on the role of proteomics in the development of new laboratory diagnostics and the implications for routine diagnosis and monitoring of diseases.
18039319	Routine fetal RHD genotyping with maternal plasma: a four-year experience in Belgium.	BACKGROUND: The objective was to evaluate the diagnostic value of RHD fetal genotyping from the plasma of D- mothers as soon as 10 weeks' gestation in a routine clinical practice in Belgium. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A prospective study was conducted between November 2002 and December 2006. DNA extraction was performed in an automated closed tube system. Fetal RHD/SRY genotypes were detected in the plasma of 563 pregnant mothers by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting multiple exons 4, 5, and 10 of the RHD gene and targeting an SRY gene sequence. These were compared to the D phenotypes determined in the 581 babies they delivered. RESULTS: By combining amplification of three exons, the concordance rate of fetal RHD genotypes in maternal plasma and newborn D phenotypes at delivery was 100 percent (99.8% including one unusual false-positive). The presence of nonfunctional RHD genes and the absence of a universal fetal marker, irrespective of fetal sex, did not influence the accuracy of fetal RhD status prediction. The RHD genotyping from 18 twin pregnancies was also assessed. Five weak D women were excluded from the RHD fetal genotyping prediction. Three discrepant results (0.5%) between predicted fetal genotype and cord blood phenotype were not confirmed by the baby phenotypes from venipuncture blood. CONCLUSION: Prenatal prediction of fetal RHD by targeting multiple exons from the maternal plasma with real-time PCR is highly sensitive and accurate. Over 4 years, this experience has highly modified our management of D- pregnant women.
18039323	The rate of genome stabilization in homoploid hybrid species.	Homoploid hybrid speciation has been recognized for its potential rapid completion, an idea that has received support from experimental and modeling studies. Following initial hybridization, the genomes of parental species recombine and junctions between chromosomal blocks of different parental origin leave a record of recombination and the time period before homogenization of the derived genome. We use detailed genetic maps of three hybrid species of sunflowers and models to estimate the time required for the stabilization of the new hybrid genome. In contrast to previous estimates of 60 or fewer generations, we find that the genomes of three hybrid sunflower species were not stabilized for hundreds of generations. These results are reconciled with previous research by recognizing that the stabilization of a hybrid species' genome is not synonymous with hybrid speciation. Segregating factors that contribute to initial ecological or intrinsic genetic isolation may become stabilized quickly. The remainder of the genome likely becomes stabilized over a longer time interval, with recombination and drift dictating the contributions of the parental genomes. Our modeling of genome stabilization provides an upper bound for the time interval for reproductive isolation to be established and confirms the rapid nature of homoploid hybrid speciation.
18039329	Phylogenetic and geographic variation in host breadth and composition by herbivorous amphipods in the family Ampithoidae.	Predicting the host range for herbivores has been a major aim of research into plant-herbivore interactions and an important model system for understanding the evolution of feeding specialization. Among many terrestrial insects, host range is strongly affected by herbivore phylogeny and long historical associations between particular herbivore and plant taxa. For small herbivores in marine environments, it is known that the evolution of host use is sculpted by several ecological factors (e.g., food quality, value as a refuge from predators, and abiotic forces), but the potential for phylogenetic constraints on host use remains largely unexplored. Here, we analyze reports of host use of herbivorous amphipods from the family Ampithoidae (102 amphipod species from 12 genera) to test the hypotheses that host breadth and composition vary among herbivore lineages, and to quantify the extent to which nonpolar secondary metabolites mediate these patterns. The family as a whole, and most individual species, are found on a wide variety of macroalgae and seagrasses. Despite this polyphagous host use, amphipod genera consistently differed in host range and composition. As an example, the genus Peramphithoe rarely use available macrophytes in the order Dictyotales (e.g., Dictyota) and as a consequence, display a more restricted host range than do other genera (e.g., Ampithoe, Cymadusa, or Exampithoe). The strong phylogenetic effect on host use was independent of the uneven distribution of host taxa among geographic regions. Algae that produced nonpolar secondary metabolites were colonized by higher numbers of amphipod species relative to chemically poor genera, consistent with the notion that secondary metabolites do not provide algae an escape from amphipod herbivory. In contrast to patterns described for some groups of phytophagous insects, marine amphipods that use chemically rich algae tended to have broader, not narrower, host ranges. This result suggests that an evolutionary advantage to metabolite tolerance in marine amphipods may be that it increases the availability of appropriate algal hosts (i.e., enlarges the resource base).
18039593	Changes in motor cortical excitability induced by high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation of different stimulation durations.	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the changes in cortical excitability of the human motor cortex induced by high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of different stimulation durations. METHODS: Twenty healthy subjects participated in the study. Subjects received 20 trains of 10-Hz rTMS at 80% of the resting motor threshold (RMT) intensity with two different stimulation durations (5 and 1.5s) over the motor hot spot for left first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle. Electromyographic responses (motor-evoked potentials, MEPs) to single-pulse stimulation, and intracortical inhibition (ICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF) by paired-pulse stimulation were measured bilaterally in the relaxed FDI muscles before, immediately after, and 30, 60, 90 and 120 min after rTMS. RESULTS: After 5s of 10-Hz rTMS, the mean amplitude of MEP for the stimulated M1 cortex decreased for up to 90min (P=0.002) and that of the unstimulated M1 cortex decreased for up to 60 min (P=0.008). Enhancement of ICI and suppression of ICF were observed and sustained for more than 90 min in both stimulated (P=0.001) and unstimulated (P=0.003) M1 cortex after 5s of 10-Hz rTMS. After 1.5s of 10-Hz rTMS, the mean amplitude of MEP increased in stimulated cortex for up to 120 min (P=0.005). CONCLUSIONS: With different stimulation durations, high-frequency subthreshold rTMS can produce different patterns of long-lasting changes in corticospinal and intracortical excitability in stimulated and unstimulated motor cortex in healthy subjects. SIGNIFICANCE: The results have important implications for the selection of stimulation parameters other than the frequency of rTMS. The clinical application of rTMS for the purpose of motor enhancement should be considered along with the mechanism of different stimulation parameters.
18039654	The pentatricopeptide repeats present in Pet309 are necessary for translation but not for stability of the mitochondrial COX1 mRNA in yeast.	Pet309 is a protein essential for respiratory growth. It is involved in translation of the yeast mitochondrial COX1 gene, which encodes subunit I of the cytochrome c oxidase. Pet309 is also involved in stabilization of the COX1 mRNA. Mutations in a similar human protein, Lrp130, are associated with Leigh syndrome, where cytochrome c oxidase activity is affected. The sequence of Pet309 reveals the presence of at least seven pentatricopeptide repeats (PPRs) located in tandem in the central portion of the protein. Proteins containing PPR motifs are present in mitochondria and chloroplasts and are in general involved in RNA metabolism. Despite the increasing number of proteins from this family found to play essential roles in mitochondria and chloroplasts, little is understood about the mechanism of action of the PPR domains present in these proteins. In a series of in vivo analyses we constructed a pet309 mutant lacking the PPR motifs. Although the stability of the COX1 mRNA was not affected, synthesis of Cox1 was abolished. The deletion of one PPR motif at a time showed that all the PPR motifs are required for COX1 mRNA translation and respiratory growth. Mutations of basic residues in PPR3 caused reduced respiratory growth. According to a molecular model, these residues are facing a central cavity that could be involved in mRNA-binding activity, forming a possible path for this molecule on Pet309. Our results show that the RNA metabolism function of Pet309 is found in at least two separate domains of the protein.
18039660	Autophosphorylation docking site Tyr-867 in Mer receptor tyrosine kinase allows for dissociation of multiple signaling pathways for phagocytosis of apoptotic cells and down-modulation of lipopolysaccharide-inducible NF-kappaB transcriptional activation.	Efficient clearance of apoptotic cells is essential for tissue homeostasis, allowing for cellular turnover without inflammatory consequences. The Mer (Nyk and c-Eyk) receptor tyrosine kinase (Mertk) is involved in two aspects of apoptotic cell clearance by acting as a receptor for Gas6, a gamma-carboxylated phosphatidylserine-binding protein that bridges apoptotic and viable cells. First, Mertk acts in a bona fide engulfment pathway in concert with alphavbeta5 integrin by regulating cytoskeletal assemblages, and second, it acts as a negative regulator for inflammation by down-modulating pro-inflammatory signals mediated from bacterial lipopolysaccharide-Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling, and hence recapitulating anti-inflammatory immune modulation by apoptotic cells. Here we describe Mertk post-receptor events that govern phagocytosis and cytoskeletal signaling are principally mediated by autophosphorylation site Tyr-867. Using the Mertk Y867F mutant and pharmacological inhibitors, we show that Tyr-867 is required for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and phospholipase Cgamma2 activation; their activation in turn elicits protein kinase C-dependent signals that act on the actin cytoskeleton. Although Mertk(Y867F) blocked the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK on Tyr-861 and p130(cas) and also abrogated the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, this mutant did not suppress lipopolysaccharide-inducible NF-kappaB transcription, nor was NF-kappaB activation dependent on the protein kinase C inhibitor, calphostin C. Finally, unlike the cytoskeletal events associated with Tyr-867 autophosphorylation, the trans-inhibition of NF-kappaB occurred in a postnuclear-dependent fashion independent of cytosolic IkappaB phosphorylation and p65/RelA sequestration. Taken together, these data suggest that Mertk has distinct and separable effects for phagocytosis and for resolving inflammation, providing a molecular rationale for how immune licensing and inflammation can be dissociated from phagocytosis in a single phagocytic receptor.
18039668	Ligand dynamics and early signaling events in the heme domain of the sensor protein Dos from Escherichia coli.	In the heme-based sensor Dos from Escherichia coli, the ferrous heme is coordinated by His-77 and Met-95. The latter residue is replaced upon oxygen binding or oxidation of the heme. Here we investigate the early signaling processes upon dissociation of the distal ligand using ultrafast spectroscopy and site-directed mutagenesis. Geminate CO rebinding to the heme domain DosH appears insensitive to replacement of Met-95, in agreement with the notion that this residue is oriented out of the heme pocket in the presence of external ligands. A uniquely slow 35-ps phase in rebinding of the flexible methionine side chain after dissociation from ferrous DosH is completely abolished in rebinding of the more rigid histidine side chain in the M95H mutant protein, where only the 7-ps phase, common to all 6-coordinate heme proteins, is observed. Temperature-dependence studies indicate that all rebinding of internal and external ligands is essentially barrierless, but that CfigsO escape from the heme pocket is an activated process. Solvent viscosity studies combined with molecular dynamics simulations show that there are two configurations in the ferrous 6-coordinate protein, involving two isomers of the Met-95 side chain, of which the structural changes extend to the solvent-exposed backbone, which is part of the flexible FG loop. One of these configurations has considerable motional freedom in the Met-95-dissociated state. We suggest that this configuration corresponds to an early signaling intermediate state, is responsible for the slow rebinding, and allows small ligands in the protein to efficiently compete for binding with the heme.
18039704	Indirect readout in drug-DNA recognition: role of sequence-dependent DNA conformation.	DNA-binding drugs have numerous applications in the engineered gene regulation. However, the drug-DNA recognition mechanism is poorly understood. Drugs can recognize specific DNA sequences not only through direct contacts but also indirectly through sequence-dependent conformation, in a similar manner to the indirect readout mechanism in protein-DNA recognition. We used a knowledge-based technique that takes advantage of known DNA structures to evaluate the conformational energies. We built a dataset of non-redundant free B-DNA crystal structures to calculate the distributions of adjacent base-step and base-pair conformations, and estimated the effective harmonic potentials of mean force (PMF). These PMFs were used to calculate the conformational energy of drug-DNA complexes, and the Z-score as a measure of the binding specificity. Comparing the Z-scores for drug-DNA complexes with those for free DNA structures with the same sequence, we observed that in several cases the Z-scores became more negative upon drug binding. Furthermore, the specificity is position-dependent within the drug-bound region of DNA. These results suggest that DNA conformation plays an important role in the drug-DNA recognition. The presented method provides a tool for the analysis of drug-DNA recognition and can facilitate the development of drugs for targeting a specific DNA sequence.
18039845	Primary ciliary dyskinesia in mice lacking the novel ciliary protein Pcdp1.	Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) results from ciliary dysfunction and is commonly characterized by sinusitis, male infertility, hydrocephalus, and situs inversus. Mice homozygous for the nm1054 mutation develop phenotypes associated with PCD. On certain genetic backgrounds, homozygous mutants die perinatally from severe hydrocephalus, while mice on other backgrounds have an accumulation of mucus in the sinus cavity and male infertility. Mutant sperm lack mature flagella, while respiratory epithelial cilia are present but beat at a slower frequency than wild-type cilia. Transgenic rescue demonstrates that the PCD in nm1054 mutants results from the loss of a single gene encoding the novel primary ciliary dyskinesia protein 1 (Pcdp1). The Pcdp1 gene is expressed in spermatogenic cells and motile ciliated epithelial cells. Immunohistochemistry shows that Pcdp1 protein localizes to sperm flagella and the cilia of respiratory epithelial cells and brain ependymal cells in both mice and humans. This study demonstrates that Pcdp1 plays an important role in ciliary and flagellar biogenesis and motility, making the nm1054 mutant a useful model for studying the molecular genetics and pathogenesis of PCD.
18039922	Factors associated with the selection of mutations conferring resistance to protease inhibitors (PIs) in PI-experienced patients displaying treatment failure on darunavir.	The objective of this study was to characterize the mutations selected by darunavir (DRV) use in protease inhibitor (PI)-experienced patients and the associated factors. We analyzed treatment failure in 54 PI-experienced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients on a DRV- and ritonavir-containing regimen. Viral genotyping was carried out at the baseline, at between 1 and 3 months of treatment, and at between 3 and 6 months of treatment to search for the selection of mutations conferring resistance to PIs. The median baseline HIV RNA level was 4.9 log(10) copies/ml, and the median CD4 count was 87 cells/mm(3). At the baseline, the median numbers of resistance mutations were as follows: 3 DRV resistance mutations, 4 major PI resistance mutations, and 10 minor PI resistance mutations. The most common mutations that emerged at rebound included V32I (44%), I54M/L (24%), L33F (25%), I84V (21%), and L89V (12%). Multivariate analysis showed that higher baseline HIV RNA levels and smaller numbers of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor simultaneously used with DRV were associated with a higher risk of DRV resistance mutation selection. By contrast, L76V, a known DRV resistance mutation, was found to decrease the risk of selection of another DRV resistance mutation. The occurrence of virological failure while a patient was on DRV was associated with the selection of mutations that increased the level of DRV resistance without affecting susceptibility to tipranavir (TPV). In these PI-treated patients who displayed treatment failure while they were on a DRV-containing regimen, we confirmed the set of emerging mutations associated with DRV failure and identified the factors associated with the selection of these mutations. TPV susceptibility does not seem to be affected by the selection of a DRV resistance mutation.
18039948	Genomic imbalances associated with mullerian aplasia.	BACKGROUND: Aplasia of the müllerian ducts leads to absence of the uterine corpus, uterine cervix, and upper (superior) vagina. Patients with müllerian aplasia (MA) often exhibit additional clinical features such as renal, vertebral and cardiac defects. A number of different syndromes have been associated with MA, and in most cases its aetiology remains poorly understood. OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: 14 syndromic patients with MA and 46,XX G-banded karyotype were screened for DNA copy number changes by approximately 1 Mb whole genome bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) array based comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH). The detected alterations were validated by an independent method and further mapped by high resolution oligo-arrays. RESULTS: Submicroscopic genomic imbalances affecting the 1q21.1, 17q12, 22q11.21, and Xq21.31 chromosome regions were detected in four probands. Presence of the alterations in the normal mother of one patient suggests incomplete penetrance and/or variable expressivity. CONCLUSION: 4 of the 14 patients (29%) were found to have cryptic genomic alterations. The imbalances on 22q11.21 support recent findings by us and others that alterations in this chromosome region may result in impairment of müllerian duct development. The remaining imbalances indicate involvement of previously unknown chromosome regions in MA, and point specifically to LHX1 and KLHL4 as candidate genes.
18040052	Screening for compounds that induce apoptosis of cancer cells grown as multicellular spheroids.	Screening and initial characterization of anticancer drugs are typically performed using monolayer cultures of tumor cells. It is well established that such monolayer cultures do not represent the characteristics of 3-dimensional solid tumors. The multicellular tumor spheroid model is of intermediate complexity between in vivo tumors and in vitro monolayer cultures and would be more suitable for drug screening. The authors describe a procedure in which multicellular spheroids are used to screen for compounds that induce tumor cell apoptosis. Multicellular spheroids were generated in 96-well plates, and apoptosis was determined using the M30-Apoptosense enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. A Z' factor of approximately 0.5 was observed for HCT116 colon carcinoma spheroids using staurosporine to induce apoptosis. This procedure is attractive for secondary screening of hits from larger cell-based screens.
18040599	Reliability and validity of the Italian version of the hand functional disability scale in patients with systemic sclerosis.	The English version of hand functional disability scale is a validated instrument for measuring hand involvement in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc). Because validation of multiple-language versions of existing validated questionnaires plays a key role in standardizing the outcome measurement and increasing the statistical power of clinical studies, this study aims to validate a translated Italian version of hand functional disability scale which is not available at the moment. The Italian version of hand functional disability scale was tested on 50 patients with SSc. To determine test-retest reliability, 40 SSc patients were asked to complete the questionnaire a second time within 2 weeks of the initial testing session. The test-retest reliability and internal consistency were determined by intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and Cronbach's alpha. External consistency was measured by comparing with an already validated test, the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), and clinical measurements. To explore the relationships among these variables, multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) was adopted. The statistical analysis of each domain and the total score revealed a good test-retest reliability (ICCs > 0.75) and internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha > 0.7). Furthermore, a good external consistency was confirmed by evaluating the differences between the distributions of hand functional disability scale score for SSc patients with or without hand involvement (arthralgias, arthritis, flexion contractures, and digital ulcers) and comparing results with those obtained for HAQ. Finally, MCA demonstrates a strong correlation among functional disability scale areas and HAQ scores. The hand functional disability scale is a self-administered questionnaire and it has been specially developed to measure hand impairment in patients with hand disorders.

18040713	MicroRNA: implications for cancer.	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNA molecules that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally. After the discovery of the first miRNA in the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans, these short regulatory RNAs have been found to be an abundant class of RNAs in plants, animals, and DNA viruses. About 3% of human genes encode for miRNAs, and up to 30% of human protein coding genes may be regulated by miRNAs. MicroRNAs play a key role in diverse biological processes, including development, cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Accordingly, altered miRNA expression is likely to contribute to human disease, including cancer. This review will summarize the emerging knowledge of the connections between human miRNA biology and different aspects of carcinogenesis. Various techniques available to investigate miRNAs will also be discussed.
18041073	Racial differences in colorectal cancer screening practices and knowledge within a low-income population.	BACKGROUND: Although colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third leading cause of cancer death among US women and is particularly deadly among African Americans, CRC screening rates remain low. Within a low-income population of women, the authors examined racial differences in practices, knowledge, and barriers related to CRC screening. METHODS: Face-to-face interviews were conducted with 941 women (white, n= 186; African American, n= 755) older than age 50 years who were living in subsidized housing communities in 11 cities in North and South Carolina. Women were asked questions about their CRC screening history and their knowledge and beliefs concerning CRC screening. RESULTS: Half (49%) of the women interviewed were within CRC screening guidelines, and this did not vary by race (P= .17). However, African American women were half as likely as white women to report having had a screening colonoscopy within the past 10 years (odds ratio [OR], 0.46; P< .001). Awareness of tests for CRC was low overall (39%) and was lower among African Americans than whites (OR, 0.44; P< .001). Compared with white women, African American women were less likely to report embarrassment as a barrier (OR, 0.59; P= .008) and more likely to report lack of insurance coverage (OR, 1.75; P= .098). CONCLUSIONS: Efforts must continue to increase women's knowledge of both CRC screening tests and colon cancer risk factors. Among these low-income women, routine encounters with the healthcare system may present opportunities to reduce deficits in CRC knowledge and to improve overall CRC screening rates.
18041643	Issues when modeling benzene, toluene, and xylene exposures using a literature database.	A database of benzene, toluene, and xylene measurements was compiled from an extensive literature review that contained information on several exposure determinants, including job type, operation, mechanism of release, process type, ventilation, temperature, distance from the source, quantity, and location. The database was used to develop statistical models for benzene, toluene, and xylene exposure as a function of operation and other workplace determinants. These models can be used to predict exposure levels for subjects enrolled in community-based case-control studies. This article presents the derived parameter estimates for specific operations and additional workplace exposure determinants and describes a number of statistical and data limitation issues that are inherent in determinants modeling of historical published data.

18041783	Cholinergic innervation of the frontal cortex: differences among humans, chimpanzees, and macaque monkeys.	Cholinergic innervation of the frontal cortex is important in higher cognitive functions and may have been altered in humans relative to other species to support human-specific intellectual capacities. To evaluate this hypothesis we conducted quantitative comparative analyses of choline acetyltransferase-immunoreactive axons in cortical areas 9, 32, and 4 among humans, chimpanzees, and macaque monkeys. Area 9 of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is involved in inductive reasoning and specific components of working memory processes, while area 32 of the medial prefrontal cortex has been implicated in theory of mind. Area 4 (primary motor cortex) was also evaluated because it is not directly associated with higher cognitive functions. The findings revealed no quantitative species differences in the three cortical areas examined, indicating that human cognitive specializations are not related to a quantitative increase in cortical cholinergic input. However, species-specific morphological specializations were observed. Clusters of cholinergic fibers that may be indicative of cortical plasticity events were present in chimpanzees and humans, but not in macaques. The other significant morphology noted was the common and distinctive oval or ovoid perisomatic staining in macaque cortices. This feature was also sporadically observed in chimpanzee cortex. Our findings suggest a potential alteration of cortical cholinergic afferents within the prefrontal cortex of humans and chimpanzees, to the exclusion of macaque monkeys.
18042215	Validation of the female sexual distress scale-revised for assessing distress in women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder.	INTRODUCTION: The concept of sexually related personal distress is currently central to the diagnosis of all female sexual dysfunctions (FSD). In the current study, we have focused on validating a slightly revised version of the Female Sexual Distress Scale (FSDS), the FSDS-Revised (FSDS-R), to enhance the sensitivity of the instrument with patients suffering from hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD). In addition, we have attempted to extend the validation generalizability of the scale by demonstrating that both instruments possess reliability and discriminative validity in premenopausal women with HSDD. AIM: To assess the validity of the revised version of the FSDS, the FSDS-R, for measuring sexual distress in women with HSDD. METHODS: A prospective methodological study carried out at 27 centers in North America enrolled 296 women aged 18-50 years with HSDD, another female sexual dysfunction (FSD), or no FSD. The subjects completed the FSDS-R at baseline, day 7, and day 28, with a 30-day recall at baseline and with a 7-day recall on days 7 and 28. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses of FSDS, FSDS-R, and FSDS-R item 13 were used for the differentiation of HSDD from no FSD, while intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to estimate test-retest reliability. Cronbach's coefficient alpha was used to measure the internal consistency of the FSDS-R and Pearson's correlation coefficient to assess FSDS, FSDS-R, and FSDS-R item 13 with different recall periods (7 and 30 days). RESULTS: Mean total FSDS, FSDS-R, and FSDS-R item 13 scores with either recall period were significantly higher (P < 0.0001) in women with FSD or HSDD than in women with no FSD, showing both tests had discriminant validity. ROC analysis confirmed these findings, while an ICC of >0.74 showed the test-retest reliability of both scales, including FSDS-R item 13 alone, and Cronbach's coefficient alpha of >0.86 confirmed the internal consistency of both tests. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with the FSDS, the FSDS-R demonstrated good discriminant validity, high test-retest reliability, and a high degree of internal consistency in measuring sexually related personal distress in women with HSDD. FSDS-R item 13 alone also demonstrated good discriminant validity and test-retest reliability.
18042230	Quantification of class 1 integron abundance in natural environments using real-time quantitative PCR.	Integrons are bacterial genetic elements capable of capturing and expressing potentially adaptive genetic material. Class 1 integrons constitute the most intensely studied group of these elements to date, mainly due to their well-established role in the acquisition and dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes in clinical environments. However, virtually nothing is known about the distribution or abundance of class 1 integrons outside of the clinical context. Here we develop a SYBR Green-based real-time quantitative PCR assay capable of quantifying the abundance of class 1 integrons in environmental samples. It was shown that the abundance of the intI1 gene in creek sediment correlates with ecological condition, implying that class 1 integrons provide selective advantages relevant to environmental pressures other than the use of antibiotics. By comparing the quantities of intI1 and 16S rRNA gene in each sample, it was demonstrated that approximately 2.7% of cells potentially harbour a class 1 integron. These findings suggest that class 1 integrons are widespread in natural environments removed from clinical settings and occur in a broader range of host organisms than had previously been assumed on the basis of culture-dependent estimates.
18042245	Constant dopaminergic stimulation by transdermal delivery of dopaminergic drugs: a new treatment paradigm in Parkinson's disease.	Current dopaminergic therapies for the treatment of Parkinson's disease are associated with the development of long-term motor complications. Abnormal pulsatile stimulation of dopamine receptors is thought to underlie the development of motor complications. There is thus a need for therapies that mimic the normal physiological state more closely by resulting in constant dopaminergic stimulation (CDS). Several studies support the hypothesis that CDS can reverse levodopa-induced motor complications. Other potential benefits of CDS include alleviating nocturnal disturbances, minimizing daytime sleepiness, avoiding priming for motor fluctuations and dyskinesia, preventing the development of gastrointestinal dysfunction and reducing the risk of developing psychosis or behavioural disturbances. Continuous infusion of dopaminergic therapies is impractical for the routine treatment of large numbers of patients. Although catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitors or sustained-release preparations of levodopa may be beneficial, they do not entirely eliminate pulsatile stimulation of dopamine receptors. A new dopamine agonist (rotigotine), delivered over 24 h by a once-daily transdermal patch, has been investigated in several clinical trials. Continuous delivery of rotigotine has been shown to provide 'true' CDS in animal models. The potential of true CDS therapy to prevent or reduce long-term motor and non-motor complications requires investigation in appropriately designed clinical trials.
18042397	Labrafil--a new adjuvant for peptide-specific oral tolerance in rat experimental autoimmune uveitis.	Application of soluble antigen via the oral route results in systemic antigen-specific tolerance, a therapeutic approach that has already been used for uveitis patients. In the Lewis rat experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) can be induced by active immunisation with retinal antigens such as retinal soluble antigen (S-Ag) or interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP) and peptides thereof. These normally pathogenic antigens can also be used to induce oral tolerance. In order to optimize oral tolerance induction we analysed the effect of Labrafil M 2125 CS, an orally administrable composition for pharmaceutical use, consisting of fatty acid esters and glycerides and capable of forming micro emulsions. Feeding peptide emulsified in Labrafil M 2125 CS/PBS prior to immunisation significantly improved oral tolerance compared to feeding peptide in PBS only. We observed a delayed onset of disease, reduced intraocular inflammation and less retinal destruction. Application of Labrafil M 2125 CS without tolerogen had no effect. Combined feeding of peptide with Labrafil M 2125 CS even allowed 10-fold reduction of the tolerogenic peptide dose. Furthermore, the effect of Labrafil M 2125 CS upon oral tolerance was dose-dependent, a peptide emulsion containing 0.5-2% Labrafil M 2125 CS achieved a maximal enhancement of oral tolerance induction, suggesting that Labrafil M 2125 CS might be a useful adjuvant to enhance therapeutic use of oral tolerance.
18042682	Crystal structure of an archaeal Ski2p-like protein from Pyrococcus horikoshii OT3.	The Ski complex composed of Ski2p, Ski3p, and Ski8p plays an essential role in the 3' to 5' cytoplasmic mRNA degradation pathway in yeast. Ski2p is a putative RNA helicase, belonging in the DExD/H-box protein families and conserved in eukarya as well as in archaea. The gene product (Ph1280p) from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus horikoshii OT3 shows sequence homology with Ski2p, sharing 22.6% identical amino acids with a central region of Ski2p. In order to gain structural information about the Ski2p-like RNA helicase, we overproduced Ph1280p in Escherichia coli cells, and purified it to apparent homogeneity. Ph1280p exhibits DNA/RNA-dependent ATPase activity with an optimal temperature at approximately 90 degrees C. The crystal structure of Ph1280p has been solved at a resolution of 3.5 A using single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) and selenomethionyl (Se-Met)-substituted protein. Ph1280p comprises four subdomains; the two N-terminal subdomains (N1 and N2) fold into an RecA-like architecture with the conserved helicase motifs, while the two C-terminal subdomains (C1 and C2) fold into alpha-helical structures containing a winged helix (WH)-fold and helix-hairpin-helix (HhH)-fold, respectively. Although the structure of each of the Ph1280p subdomains can be individually superimposed on the corresponding domains in other helicases, such as the Escherichia coli DNA helicase RecQ, the relative orientation of the helicase and C-terminal subdomains in Ph1280p is significantly different from that of other helicases. This structural feature is implicated in substrate specificity for the Ski2-like helicase and would play a critical role in the 3' to 5' cytoplasmic mRNA degradation in the Ski complex.
18043540	Non-standard radionuclide production for PET in Japan.	There is a limited number of non-standard positron emission tomography (PET) radionuclides available in Japan. At the present time, non-standard PET nuclides ((64)Cu and (62)Zn/(62)Cu generator) are available from a medium energy cyclotron at the National Institute for Radiological Sciences in Chiba, Japan. Targetry for a small cyclotron has been installed on the cyclotrons of the University of Fukui. The production and distribution of these radionuclides from these cyclotrons will be described.
18043542	Radionuclide production and yields at Washington University School of Medicine.	Washington University School of Medicine has carried out the production of ''non-standard'' nuclides for the positron emission tomography (PET) community since 1999 under the Radionuclide Resource for Cancer Applications grant R24 CA 86307 funded by the National Cancer Institute. With the support from the grant, we have successfully developed procedures for the high yield production of a wide range of radionuclides and made them available to the research community. The following non-standard PET nuclides, (60)Cu, (61)Cu, (64)Cu, (76)Br, (77)Br, (124)I, (94m)Tc, and (86)Y are routinely produced on Washington University on-site Cyclotron Corporation CS-15 or Japan Steel Works 16/8 cyclotrons. Additionally, a technique to produce (45)Ti has been developed and lately, (89)Zr is being investigated. This paper describes the production techniques and presents the performance results in terms of yields and radionuclidic purity. Sufficient yields for distribution are achieved and high radionuclide purity is also achieved yielding high quality product for medical research.
18043867	Post-transcriptional gene regulation: from genome-wide studies to principles.	Post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression plays important roles in diverse cellular processes such as development, metabolism and cancer progression. Whereas many classical studies explored the mechanistics and physiological impact on specific mRNA substrates, the recent development of genome-wide analysis tools enables the study of post-transcriptional gene regulation on a global scale. Importantly, these studies revealed distinct programs of RNA regulation, suggesting a complex and versatile post-transcriptional regulatory network. This network is controlled by specific RNA-binding proteins and/or non-coding RNAs, which bind to specific sequence or structural elements in the RNAs and thereby regulate subsets of mRNAs that partly encode functionally related proteins. It will be a future challenge to link the spectra of targets for RNA-binding proteins to post-transcriptional regulatory programs and to reveal its physiological implications.
18044712	S100A8/A9, a key mediator for positive feedback growth stimulation of normal human keratinocytes.	S100A8 and S100A9 are known to be up-regulated in hyperproliferative and psoriatic epidermis, but their function in epidermal keratinocytes remains largely unknown. Here we show that (1) S100A8 and S100A9 are secreted by cultured normal human keratinocytes (NHK) in a cytokine-dependent manner, (2) when applied to NHK, recombinant S100A8/A9 (a 1:1 mixture of S100A8 and S100A9) induced expression of a number of cytokine genes such as IL-8/CXCL8, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3, CCL20, IL-6, and TNFalpha that are known to be up-regulated in psoriatic epidermis, (3) the S100A8/A9-induced cytokines in turn enhanced production and secretion of S100A8 and S100A9 by NHK, and (4) S100A8 and S100A8/A9 stimulated the growth of NHK at a concentration as low as 1 ng/ml. These results indicate the presence of a positive feedback loop for growth stimulation involving S100A8/A9 and cytokines in human epidermal keratinocytes, implicating the relevance of the positive feedback loop to the etiology of hyperproliferative skin diseases, including psoriasis.
18044760	Telomere length and risk of Parkinson's disease.	We investigated whether telomere length was associated with the risk of Parkinson's disease (PD) in a case-control study (96 cases and 172 age-matched controls) nested within the Health Professionals Follow-up Study. Relative ratio of telomere repeat copy number to single-gene copy number in peripheral blood leukocytes was determined by quantitative real time PCR. Men with shorter telomeres had a lower PD risk (multivariate adjusted relative risk for the lowest vs. the highest quartile 0.33; 95% confidence interval: 0.12-0.90). Our results suggest that, contrary to telomere attrition observed in several aging-related diseases, shorter telomeres are not associated with an increased risk of PD.
18045612	Nest volatiles as modulators of nestmate recognition in the ant Camponotus fellah.	When ants from alien colonies encounter each other the stereotypic reaction is usually one of aggressive behavior. It has been shown that factors such as queen-derived cues or nest-odors modulate this reaction. Here we examined whether nest volatiles affect nestmate recognition by observing the reaction of nestmates towards individual workers under one of four regimes: completely isolated; isolated but receiving a constant airflow from the mother colony; as previous but with the passage of nest volatiles towards the isolated ants blocked by adsorption on a SuperQ column; or reversed airflow direction-from the isolated ants to the nest interior. Ants that had been completely isolated for three weeks were subjected to aggressive behavior, but not those that had continued to receive airflow from the mother colony. Adsorbing the nest volatiles from the airflow by SuperQ abolished this difference, with these ants now also being subjected to aggression, indicating that nest volatiles can modulate nestmate recognition. Reverse airflow also reduced the level of aggression but to a lesser extent than airflow directed from the mother colony. In queenless colonies the overall aggression was reduced under all regimes, and there was no effect of flow, suggesting that the volatiles involved are queen-borne. The SuperQ adsorbed volatiles originated from Dufour's gland secretions of both workers and queen, implicating them in the process. Cuticular hydrocarbon profiles were not affected by exposure to nest volatiles, suggesting that the latter either constitute part of the recognition cues or affect worker behavior via a different, as yet elusive mechanism.
18045776	Transcriptional activators HAP/NF-Y rescue a cytochrome c oxidase defect in yeast and human cells.	Cell survival and energy production requires a functional mitochondrial respiratory chain. Biogenesis of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), the last enzyme of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, is a very complicated process and requires the assistance of a large number of accessory factors. Defects in COX assembly alter cellular respiration and produce severe human encephalomyopathies. Mutations in SURF1, a COX assembly factor of exact unknown function, produce Leigh's syndrome (LS), the most frequent cause of COX deficiency in infants. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, deletion of the SURF1 homologue SHY1 results in a similar COX deficiency. In order to identify genetic modifiers of the shy1 mutant phenotype, we have explored for genetic interactions involving SHY1. Here we report that overexpression of Hap4p, the catalytic subunit of the CCAAT binding transcriptional activator Hap2/3/4/5p complex, suppresses the respiratory defect of yeast shy1 mutants by increasing the expression of nuclear-encoded COX subunits that interact with the mitochondrially encoded Cox1p. Analogously, overexpression of the Hap complex human homologue NF-YA/B/C transcription complex in SURF1-deficient fibroblasts from an LS patient efficiently rescues their COX deficiency.
18045789	Chromatin-associated HMG-17 is a major regulator of homeodomain transcription factor activity modulated by Wnt/beta-catenin signaling.	Homeodomain (HD) transcriptional activities are tightly regulated during embryogenesis and require protein interactions for their spatial and temporal activation. The chromatin-associated high mobility group protein (HMG-17) is associated with transcriptionally active chromatin, however its role in regulating gene expression is unclear. This report reveals a unique strategy in which, HMG-17 acts as a molecular switch regulating HD transcriptional activity. The switch utilizes the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway and adds to the diverse functions of beta-catenin. A high-affinity HMG-17 interaction with the PITX2 HD protein inhibits PITX2 DNA-binding activity. The HMG-17/PITX2 inactive complex is concentrated to specific nuclear regions primed for active transcription. beta-Catenin forms a ternary complex with PITX2/HMG-17 to switch it from a repressor to an activator complex. Without beta-catenin, HMG-17 can physically remove PITX2 from DNA to inhibit its transcriptional activity. The PITX2/HMG-17 regulatory complex acts independently of promoter targets and is a general mechanism for the control of HD transcriptional activity. HMG-17 is developmentally regulated and its unique role during embryogenesis is revealed by the early embryonic lethality of HMG-17 homozygous mice. This mechanism provides a new role for canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in regulating HD transcriptional activity during development using HMG-17 as a molecular switch.
18045802	Stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) and proteome quantitation of mouse embryonic stem cells to a depth of 5,111 proteins.	Embryonic stem (ES) cells are pluripotent cells isolated from mammalian preimplantation embryos. They are capable of differentiating into all cell types and therefore hold great promise in regenerative medicine. Here we show that murine ES cells can be fully SILAC (stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture)-labeled when grown feeder-free during the last phase of cell culture. We fractionated the SILAC-labeled ES cell proteome by one-dimensional gel electrophoresis and by isoelectric focusing of peptides. High resolution analysis on a linear ion trap-orbitrap instrument (LTQ-Orbitrap) at sub-ppm mass accuracy resulted in confident identification and quantitation of more than 5,000 distinct proteins. This is the largest quantified proteome reported to date and contains prominent stem cell markers such as OCT4, NANOG, SOX2, and UTF1 along with the embryonic form of RAS (ERAS). We also quantified the proportion of the ES cell proteome present in cytosolic, nucleoplasmic, and membrane/chromatin fractions. We compared two different preparation approaches, cell fractionation followed by one-dimensional gel separation and in-solution digestion of total cell lysate combined with isoelectric focusing, and found comparable proteome coverage with no apparent bias for any functional protein classes for either approach. Bioinformatics analysis of the ES cell proteome revealed a broad distribution of cellular functions with overrepresentation of proteins involved in proliferation. We compared the proteome with a recently published map of chromatin states of promoters in ES cells and found excellent correlation between protein expression and the presence of active and repressive chromatin marks.
18046337	Fluid regimens in the first week of life may increase risk of patent ductus arteriosus in extremely low birth weight infants.	BACKGROUND: High fluid volumes may increase neonatal morbidity. However, evidence supporting fluid restriction is inconclusive and restricting fluids may restrict caloric intake. OBJECTIVE: To determine if higher fluid intake was associated with increased risk of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 204 ELBW (<or=32 weeks, <or=1250 g) infant survivors were grouped into low-, intermediate- and high-fluid groups. chi2 analyzed proportions of subjects with and without morbidities across groups. Logistic regression quantified increased risk of PDA or BPD associated with fluid intake while controlling for confounders. Analysis of variance compared differences in caloric intake across groups. RESULT: After controlling for gestational age, severity of illness and weight change, fluid intake on day 2 (odds ratio (OR) 1.014; confidence interval (CI) 1.001 to 1.028) and day 3 (OR 1.022; CI 1.004 to 1.040) was associated with increased risk of PDA. CONCLUSION: High fluid intake (>170 ml kg(-1) day(-1)) in the first days of life is associated with increased risk of PDA.
18046449	The BCL2 rheostat in glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia.	Glucocorticoid (GC)-induced apoptosis is essential in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and related malignancies. Pro- and anti-apoptotic members of the BCL2 family control many forms of apoptotic cell death, but the extent to which this survival 'rheostat' is involved in the beneficial effects of GC therapy is not understood. We performed systematic analyses of expression, GC regulation and function of BCL2 molecules in primary ALL lymphoblasts and a corresponding in vitro model. Affymetrix-based expression profiling revealed that the response included regulations of pro-apoptotic and, surprisingly, anti-apoptotic BCL2 family members, and varied among patients, but was dominated by induction of the BH3-only molecules BMF and BCL2L11/Bim and repression of PMAIP1/Noxa. Conditional lentiviral gene overexpression and knock-down by RNA interference in the CCRF-CEM model revealed that induction of Bim, and to a lesser extent that of BMF, was required and sufficient for apoptosis. Although anti-apoptotic BCL2 members were not regulated consistently by GC in the various systems, their overexpression delayed, whereas their knock-down accelerated, GC-induced cell death. Thus, the combined clinical and experimental data suggest that GCs induce both pro- and anti-apoptotic BCL2 family member-dependent pathways, with the outcome depending on cellular context and additional signals feeding into the BCL2 rheostat.
18046509	Microsatellite markers reveal high genetic diversity in date palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.) germplasm from Sudan.	Genetic diversity in date palm germplasm from Sudan representing 37 female and 23 male accessions was investigated using 16 loci of microsatellite (SSR) primers. Eight female accessions from Morocco were included as reference material. The tested SSR markers showed a high level of polymorphism. A total of 343 alleles were detected at the 16 loci. The number of alleles per marker ranged from 14 to 44 with an average of 21.4 per locus. A high level of expected heterozygosity was observed among Sudan cultivars (0.841), Morocco cultivars (0.820) and male accessions (0.799). The results indicate that the genetic groups of the Sudan cultivars and/or males do not follow a clear geographic pattern. However, the morocco group showed significant differentiation in relation to the Sudan groups, as measured by F (ST) values and genetic distances. The effect of the methods of pollination and cultivar selection on the genetic structure was clearly detected by the weak clustering association that was observed for the majority of accessions originating from Sudan and Morocco as well. This suggests the need for further investigation on the genetic diversity of Sudanese date palm germplasm. A deeper insight will be revealed by a detailed analysis of populations originating from different geographic locations.
18046532	Analysis of TaALMT1 traces the transmission of aluminum resistance in cultivated common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.).	Allele diversities of four markers specific to intron three, exon four and promoter regions of the aluminum (Al) resistance gene of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) TaALMT1 were compared in 179 common wheat cultivars used in international wheat breeding programs. In wheat cultivars released during the last 93 years, six different promoter types were identified on the basis of allele size. A previous study showed that Al resistance was not associated with a particular coding allele for TaALMT1 but was correlated with blocks of repeated sequence upstream of the coding sequence. We verified the linkage between these promoter alleles and Al resistance in three doubled haploid and one intercross populations segregating for Al resistance. Molecular and pedigree analysis suggest that Al resistance in modern wheat germplasm is derived from several independent sources. Analysis of a population of 278 landraces and subspecies of wheat showed that most of the promoter alleles associated with Al resistance pre-existed in Europe, the Middle East and Asia prior to dispersal of cultivated germplasm around the world. Furthermore, several new promoter alleles were identified among the landraces surveyed. The TaALMT1 promoter alleles found within the spelt wheats were consistent with the hypothesis that these spelts arose on several independent occasions from hybridisations between non-free-threshing tetraploid wheats and Al-resistant hexaploid bread wheats. The strong correlation between Al resistance and Al-stimulated malate efflux from the root apices of 49 diverse wheat genotypes examined was consistent with the previous finding that Al resistance in wheat is conditioned primarily by malate efflux. These results demonstrate that the markers based on intron, exon and promoter regions of TaALMT1 can trace the inheritance of the Al resistance locus within wheat pedigrees and track Al resistance in breeding programmes.
18046562	NF-kappaB-dependent synergistic regulation of CXCL10 gene expression by IL-1beta and IFN-gamma in human intestinal epithelial cell lines.	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Little is known about the intestinal epithelial expression and secretion of CXCL10 (IP-10), a chemokine involved in recruiting T cells and monocytes. We aimed to study CXCL10 gene expression and regulation by the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1beta, interferon (IFN)-gamma and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in intestinal epithelial cell lines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CXCL10 expression and secretion kinetics were assessed in Caco-2, HT-29 and DLD1 human colon epithelial cells, treated with IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma alone or in combination with each other by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Northern blotting and enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA). Transient transfections with TGL-IP10 (CXCL10 promoter) and TGL-IP10-kappaB2 mutant promoter and gelshifts and supershifts for nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB were also performed. RESULTS: Real-time PCRs and ELISA experiments revealed that IL-1beta was the strongest and earliest inducer of CXCL10 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression and protein secretion in Caco-2 cell line, whereas INF-gamma had a delayed kinetics. There was a strong synergistic effect of either TNF-alpha or IL-1beta with IFN-gamma both on CXCL10 mRNA expression and protein secretion in all three cell lines. Real-time PCR and ELISA experiments using a specific NF-kappaB inhibitor and transfection experiments with a NF-kappaB-binding defective CXCL10 promoter construct revealed that the induction of CXCL10 by IL-1beta and its synergism with IFN-gamma is NF-kappaB dependent. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that in colonic epithelial cells, depending on the cellular context and utilizing the NF-kappaB pathway, IL-1beta alone and/or in synergism with IFN-gamma may play a major role in the induction of CXCL10.
18046569	Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on maize metaphase chromosomes with quantum dot-labeled DNA conjugates.	Semiconductor nanocrystals, also called quantum dots (QDs), are novel inorganic fluorophores which are brighter and more photostable than organic fluorophores. In the present study, highly dispersive QD-labeled oligonucleotide (TAG)(8) (QD-deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA]) conjugates were constructed via the metal-thiol bond, which can be used as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probes. FISH analysis of maize metaphase chromosomes using the QD-DNA probes showed that the probes could penetrate maize chromosomes and nuclei and solely hybridized to complementary target DNAs. Compared with the conventional organic dyes such as Cy3 and fluorescein isothiocyanate, this class of luminescent labels bound with oligonucleotides is brighter and more stable against photobleaching on the chromosomes after FISH. These results suggest that QD fluorophores may be a more stable and useful fluorescent label for FISH applications in plant chromosome mapping considering their size-tunable luminescence spectra.
18046638	The sexual self-consciousness scale: psychometric properties.	An investigation of the Sexual Self-Consciousness Scale (SSCS) is reported that aims to measure individual variability with regard to the construct of self-consciousness as experienced in sexual situations. The construct relates to the attentional-capacity model of sexual arousal. Sexual self-consciousness may constitute a vulnerability factor for the development of sexual dysfunction. In the present study, men and women with sexual dysfunction and healthy control participants were investigated (N = 282). Principal component analysis and multitrait scaling analysis showed that a two-component, oblimin-rotated solution based on 12 items and explaining 53.7% of the total variance could be well interpreted. The Sexual Embarrassment subscale (Cronbach's alpha = .84), the Sexual Self-Focus subscale (alpha = .79), and the full scale (alpha = .85) were found to have satisfactory to good internal consistency. Test-retest reliability was satisfactory for the Sexual Embarrassment subscale (r = .84), the Sexual Self-Focus subscale (r = .79), and total score (r = .83). An effect of sex was found on the Sexual Embarrassment subscale, with female participants scoring higher than male participants. Compared with sexually functional participants, sexually dysfunctional participants scored higher on the Sexual Embarrassment and Sexual Self-Focus subscales. Convergent and divergent construct validity was investigated by comparing the associations of SSCS subscales with general self-consciousness and psychological distress scales. The pattern of correlations was interpreted as providing support for the instrument's construct validity. In conclusion, the SSCS was found to have satisfactory reliability and validity characteristics, and is expected to contribute to the field of sex research and clinical sexology.
18046776	Brief communication: Comparison of methods for estimating chronological age at linear enamel formation on anterior dentition.	Linear enamel hypoplasia (LEH) is an enamel defect that records the effects of physiological stress on tooth formation. Estimating the age at which LEH defects form is integral to the reconstruction of population health in bioarcheological studies. Two principal methods for aging LEH defects have been introduced in the literature. The conventional approach employs regression equations based on a linear model of tooth growth. The newer, Reid and Dean [Am J Phys Anthropol 113 (2000) 135-139] approach, is based upon a histologically derived curvilinear model of enamel development and therefore likely provides more accurate age estimates. However, the extent to which the Reid and Dean method produces estimated ages at defect formation differing from those of the regression equations has not, until now, been determined. This study quantifies the differences between these two methods. Evaluating the degree to which these methods differ is essential for interpreting the accuracy of LEH age estimates given in previous bioarcheological studies. Age estimates of LEH defects on 338 anterior teeth from the Hamann-Todd osteological sample were calculated using both methods. The resulting estimated ages were compared through a randomized block ANOVA. However, the mean differences between the estimated ages yielded by both methods range from 4 months or less depending on the tooth type with an overall average of 2.63 months. The discussion focuses on the degree to which this difference affects answers to bioarcheological questions.
18047408	Inhomogeneities in heteroassociative memories with linear learning rules.	We investigate how various inhomogeneities present in synapses and neurons affect the performance of feedforward associative memories with linear learning, a high-level network model of hippocampal circuitry and plasticity. The inhomogeneities incorporated into the model are differential input attenuation, stochastic synaptic transmission, and memories learned with varying intensity. For a class of local learning rules, we determine the memory capacity of the model by extending previous analysis. We find that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), a measure of fidelity of recall, depends on the coefficients of variation (CVs) of the attenuation factors, the transmission variables, and the intensity of the memories, as well as the parameters of the learning rule, pattern sparsity and the number of memories stored. To predict the effects of attenuation due to extended dendritic trees, we use distributions of attenuations appropriate to unbranched and branched dendritic trees. Biological parameters for stochastic transmission are used to determine the CV of the transmission factors. The reduction in SNR due to differential attenuation is surprisingly low compared to the reduction due to stochastic transmission. Training a network by storing memories at different intensities is equivalent to using a learning rule incorporating weight decay. In this type of network, new memories can be stored continuously at the expense of older ones being forgotten (a palimpsest). We show that there is an optimal rate of weight decay that maximizes the capacity of the network, which is a factor of e lower than its nonpalimpsest equivalent.
18047467	Cell (patho)physiology of magnesium.	There is an unsettled debate about the role of magnesium as a 'chronic regulator' of biological functions, as opposed to the well-known role for calcium as an 'acute regulator'. New and old findings appear to delineate an increasingly complex and important role for magnesium in many cellular functions. This review summarizes the available evidence for a link between the regulation of intracellular magnesium availability and the control of cell growth, energy metabolism and death, both in healthy and diseased conditions. A comprehensive view is precluded by technical difficulties in tracing magnesium within a multicompartment and dynamic environment like the cell; nevertheless, the last few years has witnessed encouraging progress towards a better characterization of magnesium transport and its storage or mobilization inside the cell. The latest findings pave the road towards a new and deeper appreciation of magnesium homoeostasis and its role in the regulation of essential cell functions.
18047474	Phytochrome-mediated inhibition of shade avoidance involves degradation of growth-promoting bHLH transcription factors.	Plant growth and development are particularly sensitive to changes in the light environment and especially to vegetational shading. The shade-avoidance response is mainly controlled by the phytochrome photoreceptors. In Arabidopsis, recent studies have identified several related bHLH class transcription factors (PIF, for phytochrome-interacting factors) as important components in phytochrome signaling. In addition to a related bHLH domain, most of the PIFs contain an active phytochrome binding (APB) domain that mediates their interaction with light-activated phytochrome B (phyB). Here we show that PIF4 and PIF5 act early in the phytochrome signaling pathways to promote the shade-avoidance response. PIF4 and PIF5 accumulate to high levels in the dark, are selectively degraded in response to red light, and remain at high levels under shade-mimicking conditions. Degradation of these transcription factors is preceded by phosphorylation, requires the APB domain and is sensitive to inhibitors of the proteasome, suggesting that PIF4 and PIF5 are degraded upon interaction with light-activated phyB. Our data suggest that, in dense vegetation, which is rich in far-red light, shade avoidance is triggered, at least partially, as a consequence of reduced phytochrome-mediated degradation of transcription factors such as PIF4 and PIF5. Consistent with this idea, the constitutive shade-avoidance phenotype of phyB mutants partially reverts in the absence of PIF4 and PIF5.
18047567	Gac/Rsm signal transduction pathway of gamma-proteobacteria: from RNA recognition to regulation of social behaviour.	In many gamma-proteobacteria, the conserved GacS/GacA (BarA/UvrY) two-component system positively controls the expression of one to five genes specifying small RNAs (sRNAs) that are characterized by repeated unpaired GGA motifs but otherwise appear to belong to several independent families. The GGA motifs are essential for binding small, dimeric RNA-binding proteins of a single conserved family designated RsmA (CsrA). These proteins, which also occur in bacterial species outside the gamma-proteobacteria, act as translational repressors of certain mRNAs when these contain an RsmA/CsrA binding site at or near the Shine-Dalgarno sequence plus additional binding sites located in the 5' untranslated leader mRNA. Recent structural data have established that the RsmA-like protein RsmE of Pseudomonas fluorescens makes specific contacts with an RNA consensus sequence 5'-(A)/(U)CANGGANG(U)/(A)-3' (where N is any nucleotide). Interaction with an RsmA/CsrA protein promotes the formation of a short stem supporting an ANGGAN loop. This conformation hinders access of 30S ribosomal subunits and hence translation initiation. The output of the Gac/Rsm cascade varies widely in different bacterial species and typically involves management of carbon storage and expression of virulence or biocontrol factors. Unidentified signal molecules co-ordinate the activity of the Gac/Rsm cascade in a cell population density-dependent manner.
18047571	Mapping a common interaction site used by Plasmodium falciparum Duffy binding-like domains to bind diverse host receptors.	The Duffy binding-like (DBL) domain is a key adhesive module in Plasmodium falciparum, present in both erythrocyte invasion ligands (EBLs) and the large and diverse P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) family of cytoadherence receptors. DBL domains bind a variety of different host receptors, including intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), a receptor interaction that may have a role in infected erythrocyte binding to cerebral blood vessels and cerebral malaria. In this study, we expressed the nearly full complement of DBLbeta-C2 domains from the IT4/25/5 (IT4) parasite isolate and showed that ICAM-1-binding domains (DBLbeta-C2(ICAM-1)) were confined to group B and group C PfEMP1 proteins and were not present in group A, suggesting that ICAM-1 selection pressure differs between PfEMP1 groups. To further dissect the molecular determinants of binding, we modelled a DBLbeta-C2(ICAM-1) domain on a solved DBL structure and created alanine substitution mutants in two DBLbeta-C2(ICAM-1) domains. This analysis indicates that the DBLbeta-C2::ICAM-1 interaction maps to the equivalent glycan binding region of EBLs, and suggests a general model for how DBL domains evolve under dual selection for host receptor binding and immune evasion.
18047587	The unseen majority: soil microbes as drivers of plant diversity and productivity in terrestrial ecosystems.	Microbes are the unseen majority in soil and comprise a large portion of life's genetic diversity. Despite their abundance, the impact of soil microbes on ecosystem processes is still poorly understood. Here we explore the various roles that soil microbes play in terrestrial ecosystems with special emphasis on their contribution to plant productivity and diversity. Soil microbes are important regulators of plant productivity, especially in nutrient poor ecosystems where plant symbionts are responsible for the acquisition of limiting nutrients. Mycorrhizal fungi and nitrogen-fixing bacteria are responsible for c. 5-20% (grassland and savannah) to 80% (temperate and boreal forests) of all nitrogen, and up to 75% of phosphorus, that is acquired by plants annually. Free-living microbes also strongly regulate plant productivity, through the mineralization of, and competition for, nutrients that sustain plant productivity. Soil microbes, including microbial pathogens, are also important regulators of plant community dynamics and plant diversity, determining plant abundance and, in some cases, facilitating invasion by exotic plants. Conservative estimates suggest that c. 20 000 plant species are completely dependent on microbial symbionts for growth and survival pointing to the importance of soil microbes as regulators of plant species richness on Earth. Overall, this review shows that soil microbes must be considered as important drivers of plant diversity and productivity in terrestrial ecosystems.
18048005	The locations of mitochondria in mammalian photoreceptors: relation to retinal vasculature.	Adult mammalian photoreceptors are elongated cells, and their mitochondria are sequestered to the ends of the cell, to the inner segments and (in some species) to axon terminals in the outer plexiform layer (OPL). We hypothesised that mitochondria migrate to these locations towards sources of oxygen, from the choroid and (in some species) from the deep capillaries of the retinal circulation. Six mammalian species were surveyed, using electron and light microscopy, including immunohistochemistry for the mitochondrial enzyme cytochrome oxidase (CO). In all 6 species, mitochondria were absent from photoreceptor somas and were numerous in inner segments. Mitochondria were prominent in axon terminals in 3 species (mouse, rat, human) with a retinal circulation and were absent from those terminals in 3 species (wallaby, rat, guinea pig) with avascular retinas. Further, in a human developmental series, it was evident that mitochondria migrate within rods and cones, towards and eventually past the outer limiting membrane (OLM), into the inner segment. In Müller and RPE cells also, mitochondria concentrated at the external surface of the cells. Neurones located in the inner layers of avascular retinas have mitochondria, but their expression of CO is low. Mitochondrial locations in photoreceptors, Müller and RPE cells are economically explained as the result of migration within the cell towards sources of oxygen. In photoreceptors, this migration results in a separation of mitochondria from the nuclear genome; this separation may be a factor in the vulnerability of photoreceptors to mutations, toxins and environmental stresses, which other retinal neurones survive.
18048393	Prediction of both conserved and nonconserved microRNA targets in animals.	MOTIVATION: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in many diverse biological processes and they may potentially regulate the functions of thousands of genes. However, one major issue in miRNA studies is the lack of bioinformatics programs to accurately predict miRNA targets. Animal miRNAs have limited sequence complementarity to their gene targets, which makes it challenging to build target prediction models with high specificity. RESULTS: Here we present a new miRNA target prediction program based on support vector machines (SVMs) and a large microarray training dataset. By systematically analyzing public microarray data, we have identified statistically significant features that are important to target downregulation. Heterogeneous prediction features have been non-linearly integrated in an SVM machine learning framework for the training of our target prediction model, MirTarget2. About half of the predicted miRNA target sites in human are not conserved in other organisms. Our prediction algorithm has been validated with independent experimental data for its improved performance on predicting a large number of miRNA down-regulated gene targets. AVAILABILITY: All the predicted targets were imported into an online database miRDB, which is freely accessible at http://mirdb.org.
18048398	Monte Carlo feature selection for supervised classification.	MOTIVATION: Pre-selection of informative features for supervised classification is a crucial, albeit delicate, task. It is desirable that feature selection provides the features that contribute most to the classification task per se and which should therefore be used by any classifier later used to produce classification rules. In this article, a conceptually simple but computer-intensive approach to this task is proposed. The reliability of the approach rests on multiple construction of a tree classifier for many training sets randomly chosen from the original sample set, where samples in each training set consist of only a fraction of all of the observed features. RESULTS: The resulting ranking of features may then be used to advantage for classification via a classifier of any type. The approach was validated using Golub et al. leukemia data and the Alizadeh et al. lymphoma data. Not surprisingly, we obtained a significantly different list of genes. Biological interpretation of the genes selected by our method showed that several of them are involved in precursors to different types of leukemia and lymphoma rather than being genes that are common to several forms of cancers, which is the case for the other methods. AVAILABILITY: Prototype available upon request.
18048417	Interplay of ion binding and attraction in DNA condensed by multivalent cations.	We have measured forces generated by multivalent cation-induced DNA condensation using single-molecule magnetic tweezers. In the presence of cobalt hexammine, spermidine, or spermine, stretched DNA exhibits an abrupt configurational change from extended to condensed. This occurs at a well-defined condensation force that is nearly equal to the condensation free energy per unit length. The multivalent cation concentration dependence for this condensation force gives the apparent number of multivalent cations that bind DNA upon condensation. The measurements show that the lower critical concentration for cobalt hexammine as compared to spermidine is due to a difference in ion binding, not a difference in the electrostatic energy of the condensed state as previously thought. We also show that the resolubilization of condensed DNA can be described using a traditional Manning-Oosawa cation adsorption model, provided that cation-anion pairing at high electrolyte concentrations is taken into account. Neither overcharging nor significant alterations in the condensed state are required to describe the resolubilization of condensed DNA. The same model also describes the spermidine3+/Na+ phase diagram measured previously.
18048865	Kidney function is related to cerebral small vessel disease.	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Poor kidney function, as measured by glomerular filtration rate (GFR), is closely associated with presence of glomerular small vessel disease. Given the hemodynamic similarities between the vascular beds of the kidney and the brain, we hypothesized an association between kidney function and markers of cerebral small vessel disease on MRI. We investigated this association in a population-based study of elderly persons. METHODS: We measured GFR using the Cockcroft-Gault equation in 484 participants (60 to 90 years of age) from the Rotterdam Scan Study. Using automated MRI-analysis we measured global as well as lobar and deep volumes of gray matter and white matter, and volume of WML. Lacunar infarcts were rated visually. Volumes of deep white matter and WML and presence of lacunar infarcts reflected cerebral small vessel disease. We used linear and logistic regression models to investigate the association between GFR and brain imaging parameters. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, and additionally for cardiovascular risk factors. RESULTS: Persons with lower GFR had less deep white matter volume (difference in standardized volume per SD decrease in GFR: -0.15 [95% CI -0.26 to -0.04]), more WML (difference per SD decrease in GFR: 0.14 [95% CI 0.03 to 0.25]), and more often lacunar infarcts, although the latter was not significant. GFR was not associated with gray matter volume or lobar white matter volume. Additional adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors yielded similar results. CONCLUSIONS: Impaired kidney function is associated with markers of cerebral small vessel disease as assessed on MRI.
18049076	A patient with de-novo partial deletion of Xp (p11.4-pter) and partial duplication of 22q (q11.2-qter).	We report on a girl with partial deletion of Xp and partial duplication of 22q. Family studies demonstrate that both the patient's mother and her nonidentical twin sister carry the corresponding balanced translocation; 46,X,t(X;22)(p11.4;q11.2). This girl has developmental delay, microcephaly, mild dysmorphisms and hearing loss but otherwise shows few of the features described in individuals with duplications of the long arm of chromosome 22. She does manifest characteristics, such as short stature and biochemical evidence of ovarian failure, which are seen in partial or complete Xp deletions and Turner's syndrome.
18049079	Maternal heterodisomy/isodisomy and paternal supernumerary ring of chromosome 7 in a child with Silver-Russell syndrome.	Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) is clinically variable although most cases have several common signs. Different chromosomes and chromosomal regions have been associated with SRS. Maternal uniparental disomy (UPD) of chromosome 7 is responsible for 5-10% of cases, probably because of an imbalance between maternal and paternal imprinted genes and more recently maternal duplication or epimutations in the 11p15 imprinted region have been described. To date, only two patients with maternal UPD7 and a mosaic condition for a supernumerary ring 7 marker have been reported, and we here report a further case. Standard QFQ banding of lymphocytes as well as fluorescence in-situ hybridization analyses were performed to identify and characterize the supernumerary marker. UPD testing was performed on both the patient's and parents' DNA using chromosome 7 microsatellite markers. The patient demonstrated a ring in about 4% of the analysed cells. On the basis of cytogenetic and molecular results, break points were tentatively identified as 7p11.2 and 7q21. Maternal hetero-/iso-UPD and a paternal origin for the supernumerary ring were demonstrated. Clinical data comparison between our patient who has a SRS phenotype and cases with hetero-/iso-UPD7 mat and mosaicism for a paternally derived chromosome 7 ring and previously reported ring 7 cases suggest that the SRS phenotype is probably because of the UPD rather than to the partial trisomy.
18049480	Notch1 activation reduces proliferation in the multipotent hematopoietic progenitor cell line FDCP-mix through a p53-dependent pathway but Notch1 effects on myeloid and erythroid differentiation are independent of p53.	Signaling mediated by activation of the transmembrane receptor Notch influences cell-fate decisions, differentiation, proliferation, and cell survival. Activated Notch reduces proliferation by altering cell-cycle kinetics and promotes differentiation in hematopoietic progenitor cells. Here, we investigated if the G(1) arrest and differentiation induced by activated mNotch1 are dependent on tumor suppressor p53, a critical mediator of cellular growth arrest. Multipotent wild-type p53-expressing (p53(wt)) and p53-deficient (p53(null)) hematopoietic progenitor cell lines (FDCP-mix) carrying an inducible mNotch1 system were used to investigate the effects of proliferation and differentiation upon mNotch1 signaling. While activated Notch reduced proliferation of p53(wt)-cells, no change was observed in p53(null)-cells. Activated Notch upregulated the p53 target p21(cip/waf) in p53(wt)-cells, but not in p53(null)-cells. Induction of the p21(cip/waf) gene by activated Notch was mediated by increased binding of p53 to p53-binding sites in the p21(cip/waf) promoter and was independent of the canonical RBP-J binding site. Re-expression of p53(wt) in p53(null) cells restored the inhibition of proliferation by activated Notch. Thus, activated Notch inhibits proliferation of multipotent hematopoietic progenitor cells via a p53-dependent pathway. In contrast, myeloid and erythroid differentiation was similarly induced in p53(wt) and p53(null) cells. These data suggest that Notch signaling triggers two distinct pathways, a p53-dependent one leading to a block in proliferation and a p53-independent one promoting differentiation.
18049798	Molecular genetics of puroindolines and related genes: allelic diversity in wheat and other grasses.	The hardness or texture of cereal grains is a primary determinant of their technological and processing quality. Among members of the Triticeae, most notably wheat, much of the variation in texture is controlled by a single locus comprised of the Puroindoline a, Puroindoline b and Grain Softness Protein-1 (Gsp-1) genes. Puroindolines confer the three major texture classes of soft and hard common wheat and the very hard durum wheat. The protein products of these genes interact with lipids and are associated with the surface of isolated starch (as a protein fraction known as 'friabilin'). During the past ten years a great diversity of alleles of both Puroindoline genes have been discovered and significant advances made in understanding the relationship between the gene presence/absence, sequence polymorphism and texture of cereal grains. Efforts have also focussed on Puroindoline and Gsp-1 genes in diploid progenitors, other Triticeae grasses and synthetic wheats in order to understand the evolution of this gene family and find potentially useful variants. The puroindoline homologues in other cereals such as rye and barley are also receiving attention. This work summarises new developments in molecular genetics of puroindolines in wheat and related Triticeae grasses, and the related genes in other cereals.
18049819	Transient activation of tumor-associated T-effector/memory cells promotes tumor eradication via NK-cell recruitment: minimal role for long-term T-cell immunity in cure of metastatic disease.	Local delivery of IL-12 and GM-CSF to advanced primary tumors results in T- and NK-cell-dependent cure of disseminated disease in a murine spontaneous lung metastasis model. Post-therapy functional dynamics of cytotoxic T- and NK-cells were analyzed in primary and metastatic tumors to determine the specific roles of each subset in tumor eradication. Time-dependent depletion of CD8+ T and NK-cells demonstrated that CD8+ T-cells were critical to eradication of metastatic tumors within 3 days of treatment, but not later. In contrast, NK-cells were found to be essential to tumor regression for at least 10 days after cytokine delivery. Analysis of tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte populations in post-therapy primary tumors demonstrated that treatment resulted in the activation of tumor-associated CD8+ T-cells within 24 h as determined by IFNgamma and perforin production. T-cell activity peaked between days 1 and 3 and subsided rapidly thereafter. Activation was not accompanied with an increase in cell numbers suggesting that treatment mobilized pre-existing T-effector/memory cells without inducing proliferation. In contrast, therapy resulted in a > or = 3-fold enhancement of both the quantity and the cytotoxic activity of NK-cells in primary and metastatic tumors on day 3 post-therapy. NK-cell activity was also transient and subsided to pre-therapy levels by day 5. Depletion of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells prior to treatment completely abrogated NK-cell infiltration into primary and metastatic tumors demonstrating the strict dependence of NK-cell recruitment on pre-existing T-effector/memory cells. Treatment failed to induce significant NK-cell infiltration in IFNgamma-knockout mice establishing the central role of IFNgamma in NK-cell chemotaxis to tumors. These data show that transient activation of tumor-associated T-effector/memory and NK-cells, but not long-term CD8+ T-cell responses, are critical to suppression of metastatic disease in this model; and reveal a novel role for preexisting adaptive T-cell immunity in the recruitment of innate effectors to tumors.
18049823	Nonlinearities make a difference: comparison of two common Hill-type models with real muscle.	Compared to complex structural Huxley-type models, Hill-type models phenomenologically describe muscle contraction using only few state variables. The Hill-type models dominate in the ever expanding field of musculoskeletal simulations for simplicity and low computational cost. Reasonable parameters are required to gain insight into mechanics of movement. The two most common Hill-type muscle models used contain three components. The series elastic component is connected in series to the contractile component. A parallel elastic component is either connected in parallel to both the contractile and the series elastic component (model [CC+SEC]), or is connected in parallel only with the contractile component (model [CC]). As soon as at least one of the components exhibits substantial nonlinearities, as, e.g., the contractile component by the ability to turn on and off, the two models are mechanically different. We tested which model ([CC+SEC] or [CC]) represents the cat soleus better. Ramp experiments consisting of an isometric and an isokinetic part were performed with an in situ cat soleus preparation using supramaximal nerve stimulation. Hill-type models containing force-length and force-velocity relationship, excitation-contraction coupling and series and parallel elastic force-elongation relations were fitted to the data. To test which model might represent the muscle better, the obtained parameters were compared with experimentally determined parameters. Determined in situations with negligible passive force, the force-velocity relation and the series elastic component relation are independent of the chosen model. In contrast to model [CC+SEC], these relations predicted by model [CC] were in accordance with experimental relations. In conclusion model [CC] seemed to better represent the cat soleus contraction dynamics and should be preferred in the nonlinear regression of muscle parameters and in musculoskeletal modeling.
18049890	Single nucleotide polymorphisms of the aromatase gene (CYP19A1), HER2/neu status, and prognosis in breast cancer patients.	PURPOSE: Estrogen exposure is involved in both breast cancer susceptibility and the prognosis in patients with breast cancer. Aromatase is involved in the production of estrogens, and altered expression of it might be associated with the prognosis. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the aromatase gene, CYP19A1, on the prognosis, and in relation to tumor and patient characteristics in a cohort of breast cancer patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The cohort analyzed in this study consisted of 1,257 patients with invasive primary breast cancer. Polymorphisms rs10046, rs4646 and rs700519 were genotyped within this group. RESULTS: The variant genotypes of rs10046 and rs4646 were associated with a lower percentage of HER2-positive tumors. There was no association of rs700519 and rs4646 with disease-free survival (DFS) or overall survival (OS). The variant genotype of rs10046 was significantly associated with a better 5-year DFS (hazards ratio 0.51; 95% CI, 0.32 to 0.81; P=0.004) adjusted for age, nodal status, tumor size grading, and hormone receptor status. This effect appeared to be determined in the subgroup of premenopausal patients. CONCLUSION: SNPs rs10046 and rs4646 may influence the HER2 status of breast cancer tumors, and rs10046 genotypes are associated with an altered DFS. Genotypes of aromatase polymorphisms may influence the prognosis for breast cancer patients not only by affecting the extent of estrogen exposure but also through an alteration in tumor characteristics.
18049903	Acetylcholine inhibits long-term hypoxia-induced apoptosis by suppressing the oxidative stress-mediated MAPKs activation as well as regulation of Bcl-2, c-IAPs, and caspase-3 in mouse embryonic stem cells.	This study examined the effect of acetylcholine (ACh) on the hypoxia-induced apoptosis of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. Hypoxia (60 h) decreased both the cell viability and level of [3H] thymidine incorporation, which were prevented by a pretreatment with ACh. However, the atropine (ACh receptor [AChR] inhibitor) treatment blocked the protective effect of ACh. Hypoxia (90 min) increased the intracellular level of reactive oxygen species (ROS). On the other hand, ACh inhibited the hypoxia-induced increase in ROS, which was blocked by an atropine treatment. Subsequently, the hypoxia-induced ROS increased the level of p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation, which were inhibited by the ACh pretreatment. Moreover, hypoxic exposure (90 min) increased the level of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) phosphorylation, which was blocked by a pretreatment with SB 203580 (p38 MAPK inhibitor) or SP 600125 (JNK inhibitor). However, hypoxia (60 h) decreased the protein levels of Bcl-2 and c-IAPs (cellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins) but increased the level of caspase-3 activation. All these effects were inhibited by a pretreatment with ACh. In conclusion, ACh prevented the hypoxia-induced apoptosis of mouse ES cells by inhibiting the ROS-mediated p38 MAPK and JNK activation as well as the regulation of Bcl-2, c-IAPs, and caspase-3.
18050305	Further characterization of the first seminoma cell line TCam-2.	Testicular germ cell tumors of adolescents and adults (TGCTs) can be classified into seminomatous and nonseminomatous tumors. Various nonseminomatous cell lines, predominantly embryonal carcinoma, have been established and proven to be valuable for pathobiological and clinical studies. So far, no cell lines have been derived from seminoma which constitutes more than 50% of invasive TGCTs. Such a cell line is essential for experimental investigation of biological characteristics of the cell of origin of TGCTs, i.e., carcinoma in situ of the testis, which shows characteristics of a seminoma cell. Before a cell line can be used as model, it must be verified regarding its origin and characteristics. Therefore, a multidisciplinary approach was undertaken on TCam-2 cells, supposedly the first seminoma cell line. Fluorescence in situ hybridization, array comparative genomic hybridization, and spectral karyotyping demonstrated an aneuploid DNA content, with gain of 12p, characteristic for TGCTs. Genome wide mRNA and microRNA expression profiling supported the seminoma origin, in line with the biallelic expression of imprinted genes IGF2/H19 and associated demethylation of the imprinting control region. Moreover, the presence of specific markers, demonstrated by immunohistochemistry, including (wild type) KIT, stem cell factor, placental alkaline phosphatase, OCT3/4 (also demonstrated by a specific Q-PCR) and NANOG, and the absence of CD30, SSX2-4, and SOX2, confirms that TCam-2 is a seminoma cell line. Although mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes are rather rare in TGCTs, TCam-2 had a mutated BRAF gene (V600E), which likely explains the fact that these cells could be propagated in vitro. In conclusion, TCam-2 is the first well-characterized seminoma-derived cell line, with an exceptional mutation, rarely found in TGCTs.
18050317	Imaging periodic currents using alternating balanced steady-state free precession.	Existing functional brain MR imaging methods detect neuronal activity only indirectly via a surrogate signal such as deoxyhemoglobin concentration in the vascular bed of cerebral parenchyma. It has been recently proposed that neuronal currents may be measurable directly using MRI (ncMRI). However, limited success has been reported in neuronal current detection studies that used standard gradient or spin echo pulse sequences. The balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP) pulse sequence is unique in that it can afford the highest known SNR efficiency and is exquisitely sensitive to perturbations in free precession phase. It is reported herein that when a spin phase-perturbing periodic current is locked to an RF pulse train, phase perturbations are accumulated across multiple RF excitations and the spin magnetization reaches an alternating balanced steady state (ABSS) that effectively amplifies the phase perturbations due to the current. The alternation of the ABSS signal therefore is highly sensitive to weak periodic currents. Current phantom experiments employing ABSS imaging resulted in detection of magnetic field variations as small as 0.15nT in scans lasting for 36 sec, which is more sensitive than using gradient-recalled echo imaging.
18050319	Measurement of glycine in human brain by triple refocusing 1H-MRS in vivo at 3.0T.	A new (1)H-MRS filtering strategy for selective measurement of glycine (Gly) in human brain in vivo at 3.0T is proposed. Investigation of multiple refocusing following a 90 degrees excitation pulse indicated that triple refocusing is most effective for suppression of the strongly coupled resonances of myo-inositol (mI) at the Gly 3.55-ppm resonance. The echo times of the triple refocusing were optimized, with numerical analysis of the filtering performance, as {TE(1), TE(2), TE(3)} = {67, 62, 69} ms. Compared with the 90 degrees -acquired mI signal the mI suppression ratios of the filter were 170 and 1000, in terms of peak amplitude and area, respectively, between 3.51 and 3.59 ppm. From LCModel analyses, using density-matrix calculated spectra as basis functions, the concentration of Gly in parieto-occipital cortex of healthy adults was estimated to be 0.5 +/- 0.1 mM (mean +/- SD, n = 6), with reference to creatine at 8 mM.
18050385	Improved health-related quality of life for patients with active rheumatoid arthritis receiving rituximab: Results of the Dose-Ranging Assessment: International Clinical Evaluation of Rituximab in Rheumatoid Arthritis (DANCER) Trial.	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of rituximab treatment on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA), who have had an inadequate response to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, including biologic agents. METHODS: A randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial involving 367 rheumatoid factor-positive patients was conducted. Patients received 2 infusions 2 weeks apart of placebo (n = 122), rituximab 500 mg (n = 123), or rituximab 1000 mg (n = 122), with or without glucocorticoids. All patients received stable doses of methotrexate (10 25 mg/wk). Measures included SF-36, assessed at baseline and at 24 weeks, as well as the HAQ and FACIT-Fatigue scale assessed at baseline and monthly for 24 weeks. Patients exceeding prespecified minimal clinically important differences (MCID) were examined. Clinical efficacy measurements (ACR20/50/70 and EULAR responses) were compared with HRQOL outcomes. RESULTS: At 24 weeks, the rituximab 500 mg and 1000 mg groups both reported statistically significantly greater improvements on the SF-36 physical component summary (4.37 and 4.89 points higher, respectively, vs placebo; p < 0.001). SF-36 physical function, bodily pain, vitality, social function, and role-physical subscale scores also statistically significantly improved vs placebo. At 24 weeks, 62.6% and 67.2% of the rituximab 500 mg and 1000 mg groups, respectively, exceeded the MCID of 0.22 in HAQ (p < 0.001). For FACIT-Fatigue, 55.3% and 65.6% of patients exceeded the MCID of 3.5 points compared with 35.2% of placebo over 24 weeks (p < 0.001). ACR20/50/70 and EULAR responders demonstrated greater improvements in mean baseline to 24 week changes in SF-36 and FACIT-Fatigue scores compared with nonresponders (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Both rituximab doses in combination with methotrexate were effective in improving all HRQOL outcomes in patients with active RA consistent with clinical efficacy.
18052890	Dynamic regulation of GacA in type III secretion, pectinase gene expression, pellicle formation, and pathogenicity of Dickeya dadantii (Erwinia chrysanthemi 3937).	Dickeya dadantii (Erwinia chrysanthemi 3937) secretes exoenzymes, including pectin-degrading enzymes, leading to the loss of structural integrity of plant cell walls. A type III secretion system (T3SS) is essential for full virulence of this bacterium within plant hosts. The GacS/GacA two-component signal transduction system participates in important biological roles in several gram-negative bacteria. In this study, a gacA deletion mutant (Ech137) of D. dadantii was constructed to investigate the effect of this mutation on pathogenesis and other phenotypes. Compared with wild-type D. dadantii, Ech137 had a delayed biofilm-pellicle formation. The production of pectate lyase (Pel), protease, and cellulase was diminished in Ech137 compared with the wild-type cells. Reduced transcription of two endo-Pel genes, pelD and pelL, was found in Ech137 using a green fluorescence protein-based fluorescence-activated cell sorter promoter activity assay. In addition, the transcription of T3SS genes dspE (an effector), hrpA (a structural protein of the T3SS pilus), and hrpN (a T3SS harpin) was reduced in Ech137. A lower amount of rsmB regulatory RNA was found in gacA mutant Ech137 compared with the wild-type bacterium by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Compared with wild-type D. dadantii, a lower amount of hrpL mRNA was observed in Ech137 at 12 h grown in medium. Although the role of RsmA, rsmB, and RsmC in D. dadantii is not clear, from the regulatory pathway revealed in E. carotovora, the lower expression of dspE, hrpA, and hrpN in Ech137 may be due to a post-transcriptional regulation of hrpL through the Gac-Rsm regulatory pathway. Consequently, the reduced exoenzyme production and Pel gene expression in the mutant may be sue partially to the regulatory role of rsmB-RsmA on exoenzyme expression. Similar to in vitro results, a lower expression of T3SS and pectinase genes of Ech137 also was observed in bacterial cells inoculated into Saintpaulia ionantha leaves, perhaps accounting for the observed reduction in local maceration. Interestingly, compared with the wild-type D. dadantii, although a lower concentration of Ech137 was observed at day 3 and 4 postinoculation, there is no significant difference in bacterial concentration between the wild-type bacterium and Ech137 in the early stage of infection. Finally, the nearly abolished systemic invasion ability of Ech137 suggests that GacA of D. dadantii is essential for the pathogenicity and systemic movement of the bacterium in S. ionantha.
18053005	Gibberellins modulate light signaling pathways to prevent Arabidopsis seedling de-etiolation in darkness.	In many plants, photomorphogenesis is the default developmental program after seed germination, and provides the key features that allow adaptation to light. This program is actively repressed if germination occurs in the absence of light, through a mechanism dependent on the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity that is encoded in Arabidopsis by COP1 (CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1), which induces proteolytic degradation of transcription factors necessary for light-regulated development, such as HY5 (LONG HYPOCOTYL 5) and HYH (LONG HYPOCOTYL 5 HOMOLOG), and stabilization of transcription factors that promote skotomorphogenesis, such as PIF3 (PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 3). Seedlings deficient in gibberellin (GA) synthesis or signaling display a de-etiolated phenotype when grown in darkness, equivalent to the phenotype of cop1 mutants, which indicates that the switch between photo- and skotomorphogenesis is also under hormonal control. Here we provide evidence for the existence of crosstalk between GA and the COP1-mediated pathway, and identify HY5 and the PIF family as nodes of a regulatory network. This interaction occurs through distinct molecular mechanisms, based on the observation that GA signaling regulates protein stability of HY5, and the activity of PIF3.
18053747	Spatial patterns of brain atrophy in MCI patients, identified via high-dimensional pattern classification, predict subsequent cognitive decline.	Spatial patterns of brain atrophy in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) were measured via methods of computational neuroanatomy. These patterns were spatially complex and involved many brain regions. In addition to the hippocampus and the medial temporal lobe gray matter, a number of other regions displayed significant atrophy, including orbitofrontal and medial-prefrontal grey matter, cingulate (mainly posterior), insula, uncus, and temporal lobe white matter. Approximately 2/3 of the MCI group presented patterns of atrophy that overlapped with AD, whereas the remaining 1/3 overlapped with cognitively normal individuals, thereby indicating that some, but not all, MCI patients have significant and extensive brain atrophy in this cohort of MCI patients. Importantly, the group with AD-like patterns presented much higher rate of MMSE decline in follow-up visits; conversely, pattern classification provided relatively high classification accuracy (87%) of the individuals that presented relatively higher MMSE decline within a year from baseline. High-dimensional pattern classification, a nonlinear multivariate analysis, provided measures of structural abnormality that can potentially be useful for individual patient classification, as well as for predicting progression and examining multivariate relationships in group analyses.
18054016	Pancreatico-enterostomy for isolated main pancreatic duct disruption.	BACKGROUND: We present our experiences with isolated main pancreatic duct injuries due to blunt trauma, managed by pancreatico-enterostomies. METHODS: This is a retrospective study of seven patients, one female and six males who presented between 1997 and 2005, whose ages ranged from 10 to 54 years. Three were due to motor vehicle accidents, two due to blunt assault, one pedestrian vehicle accident and one go-cart accident. Four presented acutely and were managed surgically within 24h; two were delayed by 3 days and one by 14 days. Six had pre-operative CT scans; one had an ERCP confirming ductal transection by contrast extravasation. RESULTS: Five pancreatico-gastrostomies and two pancreatico-jejenostomies were performed. Three patients complicated; one by biliary cutaneous fistula after a left hepatic segmentectomy, one with an amylase-rich low output fistula and one with haematemesis, for which no cause could be identified. All complications were managed conservatively. Post-operative follow-up ranged between 4 and 20 weeks. No deaths occurred. CONCLUSION: In a stable patient, pancreatico-enterostomy for an isolated main pancreatic duct injury appears to be a viable option and simpler to perform than distal pancreatectomy with splenic preservation. Furthermore, it has the advantage of pancreatic tissue and spleen preservation and a low fistula rate. The authors believe pancreatico-gastrostomy to be the easier to perform.
18054026	Contributions of capillary electrophoresis to neuroscience.	Capillary electrophoresis (CE) is a small-volume separation approach amenable to the analysis of complex samples for their small molecule, peptide and protein content. A number of the features of CE make it a method of choice for addressing questions related to neurochemistry. The figures of merit inherent to CE that make it well suited for studying cell-to-cell and intracellular signaling include small sample volumes, high separation efficiency, the ability for online analyte concentration, and compatibility with sensitive and high-information content detection methods. A variety of instrumental aspects are detailed, including detection methods and sampling techniques that are particularly useful for the analysis of signaling molecules. Studies that have used these techniques to increase our understanding of neurobiology are emphasized throughout. One notable application is single neuron chemical analysis, a research area that has been greatly advanced by CE.
18054086	Gene expression profiling of porcine peripheral blood leukocytes after infection with Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae.	The gene expression profile of peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) from extreme performing pigs after infection with Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae was analysed using a custom complementary DNA (cDNA) microarray and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR). Four high performing animals with low disease-score (HP), three low performing animals with high disease-score (LP) and one medium performing animal with medium disease-score (MP) were selected for microarray profiling. PBL RNA from these eight pigs collected before and at 24h after APP infection, was examined. The study identified 92 genes that were up-regulated and four genes that were down-regulated in PBL RNA from HP pigs compared to LP pigs. The majority of differentially expressed (DE) genes were identified by virtue of their elevated expression in the HP animals at 24h post-infection. A large number of annotated DE genes are involved in innate immune response pathways. The gene expression profile of 10 DE candidate genes was further explored across the entire pig population in the same infection trial using qRT-PCR. Considerable animal-to-animal variation in PBL gene expression was observed, especially in the LP group. The qRT-PCR analysis suggested that only one true LP pig might be present in this study, which contributes significantly to the differential expression profile of the selected genes in HP animals following APP infection. This study has therefore identified a set of genes which could serve as molecular indicators for an effective immune response to APP in pigs and which could also serve as source for gene marker development in molecular genetics studies of heritable immune traits.
18054169	Progress and perspectives for atomic-resolution electron microscopy.	The transmission electron microscope (TEM) has evolved into a highly sophisticated instrument that is ideally suited to the characterization of advanced materials. Atomic-level information is routinely accessible using both fixed-beam and scanning TEMs. This report briefly considers developments in the field of atomic-resolution electron microscopy. Recent activities include renewed attention to on-line microscope control ('autotuning'), and assessment and correction of aberrations. Aberration-corrected electron microscopy has developed rapidly in several forms although more work needs to be done to identify standard imaging conditions and to explore novel operating modes. Preparation of samples and image interpretation have also become more demanding. Ongoing problems include discrepancies between measured and simulated image contrast, concerns about radiation damage, and inversion of electron scattering.
18054215	The larval head of Raphidia (Raphidioptera, Insecta) and its phylogenetic significance.	External and internal head structures of larval representatives of Raphidiidae are described. The obtained data were compared to characters of other neuropterid larvae and to larval characters of representatives of other endopterygote lineages. Characters potentially relevant for phylogenetic reconstruction are listed and discussed. The larvae of Raphidioptera differ distinctly from other neuropterid larvae in their morphology. They are mainly characterised by autapomorphic and plesiomorphic character states and few features indicate systematic affinities with other groups. Endopterygote groundplan features maintained in Raphidioptera are the complete tentorium, the free labrum, the full set of labral muscles, the presence of four extrinsic antennal muscles, the three-segmented labial palpi, the presence of a full set of extrinsic maxillary and labial muscles, the presence of a salivarium, and possibly the high number of stemmata. Apomorphies likely correlated with predaceous habits are the long gula, the protracted maxillae, the longitudinal arrangement of extrinsic maxillary muscles, and the elongated prepharyngeal tube. Highly unusual, potentially autapomorphic features are the presence of a dorsal ligament of the tentorium and paired gland-like structures below the pharynx. A prognathous or very slightly inclined head and slender mandibles without mola are features shared by larvae of all orders of Neuropterida. The parallel-sided head is a potential synapomorphy of Raphidioptera and Megaloptera. A fully prognathous head with anteriorly shifted posterior tentorial grooves and the presence of a parietal ridge and a distinct neck region are features shared with Corydalidae. Characters of the larval head are not sufficient for a reliable placement of Raphidioptera.
18054234	14-3-3 cruciform-binding proteins as regulators of eukaryotic DNA replication.	Cruciforms are secondary DNA structures, serving as recognition signals at or near eukaryotic (yeast and mammalian) origins of DNA replication. The cruciform-binding protein is a member of the 14-3-3 protein family and binds to origins of DNA replication in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Five 14-3-3 protein isoforms (beta, gamma, epsilon, zeta and sigma) have been identified as having cruciform binding activity.
18054249	Applications of direct detection device in transmission electron microscopy.	A prototype direct detection device (DDD) camera system has shown great promise in improving both the spatial resolution and the signal to noise ratio for electron microscopy at 120-400 keV beam energies (Xuong et al., 2007. Methods in Cell Biology, 79, 721-739). Without the need for a resolution-limiting scintillation screen as in the charge coupled device (CCD), the DDD camera can outperform CCD based systems in terms of spatial resolution, due to its small pixel size (5 microm). In this paper, the modulation transfer function (MTF) of the DDD prototype is measured and compared with the specifications of commercial scientific CCD camera systems. Combining the fast speed of the DDD with image mosaic techniques, fast wide-area imaging is now possible. In this paper, the first large area mosaic image and the first tomography dataset from the DDD camera are presented, along with an image processing algorithm to correct the specimen drift utilizing the fast readout of the DDD system.
18054437	Tactile discrimination, but not tactile stimulation alone, reduces chronic limb pain.	Chronic pain is often associated with reduced tactile acuity. A relationship exists between pain intensity, tactile acuity and cortical reorganisation. When pain resolves, tactile function improves and cortical organisation normalises. Tactile acuity can be improved in healthy controls when tactile stimulation is associated with a behavioural objective. We hypothesised that, in patients with chronic limb pain and decreased tactile acuity, discriminating between tactile stimuli would decrease pain and increase tactile acuity, but tactile stimulation alone would not. Thirteen patients with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) of one limb underwent a waiting period and then approximately 2 weeks of tactile stimulation under two conditions: stimulation alone or discrimination between stimuli according to their diameter and location. There was no change in pain (100 mm VAS) or two-point discrimination (TPD) during a no-treatment waiting period, nor during the stimulation phase (p > 0.32 for both). Pain and TPD were lower after the discrimination phase [mean (95% CI) effect size for pain VAS = 27 mm (14-40 mm) and for TPD = 5.7 mm (2.9-8. ), p < 0.015 for both]. These gains were maintained at three-month follow-up. We conclude that tactile stimulation can decrease pain and increase tactile acuity when patients are required to discriminate between the type and location of tactile stimuli.
18054793	Telomere ResQue and preservation--roles for the Werner syndrome protein and other RecQ helicases.	Werner syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder resulting from loss of function of the RecQ helicase, WRN protein. WS patients prematurely develop numerous clinical symptoms and diseases associated with aging early in life and are predisposed to cancer. WRN protein and many other RecQ helicases in general, seem to function during DNA replication in the processing of stalled replication forks. Genetic, cellular and biochemical evidence support roles for WRN in proper replication and repair of telomeric DNA, and indicate that telomere dysfunction contributes to the WS disease pathology.
18054811	Identification and characterization of a late AH1N2 human reassortant in France during the 2002-2003 influenza season.	We have previously shown a clear differential genetic evolution of the hemagglutinin (HA) of human AH1N1 and AH1N2 viruses, isolated in southern France between 2001 and 2004. However, our analysis revealed that one single AH1N2 isolate, detected in 2003 (A/Lyon/0838/2003), had its HA clustering within the HAs of the AH1N1 subtypes. To determine if this virus was a new reassortant, the nucleotide sequences of its eight RNA gene segments were compared with those of five representative strains of the AH1N1, AH1N2 and AH3N2 viruses, isolated during the same time-period. According to the sequences obtained, the neuraminidase (NA) gene segment of the A/Lyon/0838/2003 (H1N2) virus was genetically closely related to those of the AH1N2 viruses, whereas the six internal genes appeared to be clustering with those of the AH1N1 viruses. This suggested that the A/Lyon/0838/2003 (H1N2) virus was the result of a second reassortment event that had occurred during the winter of 2002-2003; the N2 gene segment of an AH1N2 virus being introduced into an AH1N1 genetic background. Subsequently, we analysed the extremities of each gene segment of the viruses from the different subtypes, and experimentally reproduced, in vitro, AH1N2 reassortant viruses through co-infection of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells with both AH1N1 and AH1N2 viruses, isolated in the 2002-2003 influenza season. While the comparison of the AH1N1 and the AH1N2 gene segment extremities revealed no major differences, we successfully reproduced an AH1N2 reassortant virus similar to the A/Lyon/0838/2003 (H1N2) virus. This result provided an experimental evidence of the compatibility between their respective surface H1 and N2 glycoproteins, and suggests that similar events may occur silently amongst human subtypes.
18054821	An evaluation of therapeutic and reactivating effects of newly developed oximes (K156, K203) and commonly used oximes (obidoxime, trimedoxime, HI-6) in tabun-poisoned rats and mice.	The potency of newly developed monoxime bispyridinium compounds (K156, K203) in reactivating tabun-inhibited acetylcholinesterase and reducing tabun-induced lethal toxic effects was compared with commonly used oximes (obidoxime, trimedoxime, the oxime HI-6) using in vivo methods. Studies determining percentage of reactivation of tabun-inhibited blood and tissue acetylcholinesterase in poisoned rats showed that the reactivating efficacy of newly developed oxime K203 is comparable with obidoxime and trimedoxime in blood and higher than the reactivating potency of trimedoxime and obidoxime in diaphragm and brain, where the difference in reactivating efficacy of obidoxime, trimedoxime and K203 is significant. On the other hand, the potency of newly developed K156 to reactivate tabun-inhibited acetylcholinesterase is comparable with obidoxime or trimedoxime in diaphragm and brain. It is significantly lower than the reactivating efficacy of trimedoxime and obidoxime in blood. Moreover, both newly developed oximes were found to be relatively efficacious in the reduction of lethal toxic effects in tabun-poisoned mice. Especially, the oxime K203 is able to decrease the acute toxicity of tabun nearly two times. The therapeutic efficacy of K156 and K203 corresponds to their potency to reactivate tabun-inhibited acetylcholinesterase, especially in diaphragm and brain. In contrast to obidoxime and trimedoxime, the oxime HI-6 is not effective in reactivation of tabun-inhibited acetycholinesterase and in reducing tabun lethality. While the oxime K156 does not improve the reactivating and therapeutic effectiveness of currently available obidoxime and trimedoxime, the newly developed oxime K203 is markedly more effective in reactivation of tabun-inhibited acetylcholinesterase in rats, especially in brain, and in reducing lethal toxic effects of tabun in mice and, therefore, it is suitable for the replacement of commonly used oximes for the antidotal treatment of acute tabun poisoning.
18054823	Inhibition, reactivation and aging kinetics of highly toxic organophosphorus compounds: pig versus minipig acetylcholinesterase.	Organophosphorus compound-based (OP) chemical warfare agents (nerve agents) represent a continuing threat to military forces and the civilian population. OPs act primarily by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (AChE), the standard treatment for which includes AChE reactivators (oximes) in combination with antimuscarinic drugs. In the last decades, the efficacy of oximes has been investigated mostly in small animal models. In order to increase the predictive value of animal studies it is desirable to measure numerous physiological and biochemical parameters. This is difficult in small animals. Large animal models fulfil these requirements and swine are increasingly being used in toxicology studies. Swine breeds generally show considerable variability in different characteristics which may be minimised by the use of specially bred minipigs which have a known genetic background and health status. A comparative study was, therefore, initiated to investigate the kinetic properties of the White Landrace pig and Göttingen minipig AChE in respect of inhibition by the pesticide paraoxon; the nerve agents cyclosarin, VX and VR; the reactivation of inhibited AChE by oximes (obidoxime, pralidoxime and HI 6); and the aging and spontaneous reactivation of inhibited AChE. The determination of the respective kinetic constants found similarities between pig and minipig AChE which showed marked differences in comparison with human AChE values. This has to be considered in designing meaningful models for the investigation of oxime efficacy in pig or minipig experiments. The generated data indicate comparable kinetic properties of pig and minipig AChE and may provide a kinetic basis for extrapolation of data from pig studies to humans.
18054956	Structure of the Yersinia enterocolitica type III secretion translocator chaperone SycD.	Many Gram-negative bacteria use a type III secretion (T3S) system to directly inject effector molecules into eucaryotic cells in order to establish a symbiotic or pathogenic relationship with their host. The translocation of many T3S proteins requires specialized chaperones from the bacterial cytosol. SycD belongs to a class of T3S chaperones that assists the secretion of pore-forming translocators and, specifically chaperones the translocators YopB and YopD from enteropathogenic Yersinia enterocolitica. In addition, SycD is involved in the regulation of virulence factor biosynthesis and secretion. In this study, we present two crystal structures of Y. enterocolitica SycD at 1.95 and 2.6 A resolution, the first experimental structures of a T3S class II chaperone specific for translocators. The fold of SycD is entirely alpha-helical and reveals three tetratricopeptide repeat-like motifs that had been predicted from amino acid sequence. In both structures, SycD forms dimers utilizing residues from the first tetratricopeptide repeat motif. Using site-directed mutagenesis and size exclusion chromatography, we verified that SycD forms head-to-head homodimers in solution. Although in both structures, dimerization largely depends on the same residues, the two assemblies represent alternative dimers that exhibit different monomer orientations and overall shape. In these two distinct head-to-head dimers, both the concave and the convex surface of each monomer are accessible for interactions with the SycD binding partners YopB and YopD. A SycD variant carrying two point mutations in the dimerization interface is properly folded but defective in dimerization. Expression of this stable SycD monomer in Yersinia does not rescue the phenotype of a sycD null mutant, suggesting a physiological relevance of the dimerization interface.
18054980	Change in the accommodative force on the lens of the human eye with age.	The aim of the study was to determine the age-dependence of the accommodative force on the lens in order to make it clear whether the causes of presbyopia are due to lenticular or extralenticular changes. A finite element model of the lens of an 11-, 29- and 45-year-old human eye was constructed to represent the fully accommodated state. Subsequently, the force that was needed to mould the lens into its unaccommodated state was calculated. The force on the lens appeared to be preserved with age, with only a slight increase to a value of approximately 0.06N. In conclusion, the preservation of the net force delivered by the extralenticular ciliary body indicates that the causes of presbyopia must be ascribed to lenticular changes.
18055095	Early onset vulvar Lichen Sclerosus in premenopausal women and oral contraceptives.	OBJECTIVE: For vulvar Lichen sclerosus (LS) immunological factors, genetic predisposition, and decreased 5 alpha-reductase activity have been discussed as aetiological factors. During the last decade an increase of LS in young women has been suspected. Aim of this study was to evaluate data of premenopausal women with early onset LS to find potential risk factors focussing on the use of oral contraceptives. STUDY DESIGN: We retrospectively analyzed the data of 40 premenopausal patients with early onset LS regarding use of oral contraceptives (OCPs), and first occurrence of LS. To compare these data in a case-control study we analyzed a matched control group of 110 healthy women. RESULTS: All our LS patients were using OCPs compared to 73 women (66.4%) in the control group. OCPs with anti-androgenic activity (chlormadinone acetate, cyproterone acetate, dienogest, and drospirenone) were used by 28 (70%) of the LS patients and by 35 (47.9%) of the 73 women using OCPs in the control group. Thus, the odds ratio for early onset LS for women using anti-androgenic OCPs was 2.53 (95% CI: 1.12-5.75). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that disturbance of the androgen dependent growth of the vulvar skin by OCPs and especially by OCPs with anti-androgenic properties might trigger the early onset of LS in a subgroup of susceptible young women.
18055108	Extraction of heavy metal ions from leachate of cement-based stabilized waste using purpurin functionalized resin.	A new chelating resin was synthesized by functionalization of a polymer support, Amberlite XAD-2 with purpurin through an azo linkage (NN). The products were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, elemental analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. The optimum conditions for the extraction of Cd(II), Cr(III) and Pb(II) in two matrices; leachate from cement-based material and de-ionized water, were studied by batch and column methods. The determination of the metal ions was carried out by flame atomic absorption spectrometry. The optimum pH for the extraction of all metal ions in both matrices were at 4.0. Their sorption equilibrium was reached within 1h. The sorbed Cd(II) and Pb(II) were eluted by 1% HNO3 within 10 min with the desorption recovery of >90%. The elution of Cr(III) by 3% H2O2 in 0.1 M NaOH was achieved within 30 min with the desorption recovery of >80%. The sorption capacity of Cd(II), Cr(III) and Pb(II) onto the resin was 75.0, 68.2, 82.7 micromol g(-1) resin in DI water and 54.1, 46.5 and 55.7 micromol g(-1) resin in leachate, respectively. The extraction efficiency in the column method can be improved using the recirculation system. This new method gave a good accuracy in batch system with the recovery of 86.5 and 89.9% for Cd(II) and Pb(II) and R.S.D. less than 2.3% (n=14).
18055119	National study of the gastrointestinal parasites of dogs and cats in Australia.	The prevalence of gastrointestinal parasites in Australian pet dogs and cats was largely unknown prior to this study. Current recommendations for the prophylactic treatment of parasites in Australia are based on studies conducted 20-30 years ago. A total of 1400 canine and 1063 feline faecal samples were collected from veterinary clinics and refuges from across Australia. The overall prevalence of gastrointestinal parasites in dogs and cats was 23.9% (CI 21.7-26.1) and 18.4% (CI 16.1-20.7), respectively. Overall Giardia was the most prevalent parasite in dogs (9.3% CI 7.8-10.8) followed by hookworm (6.7% CI 5.4-8.0). Isospora felis was the most prevalent parasite in cats (5.6% CI 4.2-7.0), followed by Toxocara cati (3.2% CI 2.1-4.3). In conclusion the prevalence of intestinal helminths in Australian pet dogs and cats is low. Consequently, consideration should be given to the future use of anthelmintics and continued emphasis on pet owner education as means of preventing infection.
18055142	A novel system for three-pulse drug release based on "tablets in capsule" device.	The objective of the present study was to obtain programmed drug delivery from a novel system, which contains a water-soluble cap, impermeable capsule body, and two multi-layered tablets. Types of materials for the modulating barrier and its weight can significantly affect the lag time (defined as the time when drug released 8% of the single pulse dosage). We chose sodium alginate and hydroxy-propyl methyl cellulose (HPMC E5) as the candidate modulating barrier material. Through adjusting ratio of sodium alginate and lactose, lag time was controllable between the first two pulsatile release. Linear relationship was observed between the ratio and the lag time. Through adjusting the ratio of HPMC E5/lactose, lag time between the second and the third pulse can be successfully modulated. In further studies, drug release rate of the second pulsatile dose can be improved by adding a separating layer between the third and the modulating barrier layer in the three-layered tablet. To evaluate contribution of bulking agent to drug release rate, lactose, sodium chloride, and effervescent blend were investigated. No superiority was found using sodium chloride and effervescent blend. However, lactose favored it. The results reveal that programmed drug delivery to achieve pulsatile drug release for three times daily can be obtained from these tablets in capsule system by systemic formulation approach.
18055216	How has DISC1 enabled drug discovery?	Growing genetic and clinical evidence has shown that disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) is one of the most compelling risk genes for schizophrenia and other major mental disorders. The understanding of the role that DISC1 plays in neuronal development and cell signaling has been greatly enhanced by the identification of DISC1 binding partners, an appreciation of its expression during development and functional studies using RNA interference. But what is the impact of this explosion of data for psychiatric drug discovery? Though we are at a very early stage of our understanding of DISC1 biology, it is an important time to review what has already been achieved and to discuss its impact. DISC1 biology has enabled the identification of new therapeutic targets in the form of DISC1 binding partners and other molecules found within a large DISC1 interaction network, the so-called 'DISC1 interactome'. We will review the better characterized of these interactions and also emphasize the richness of potential targets in the more poorly studied areas of the interactome. Furthermore, DISC1 has encouraged the development of new animal models for psychiatric disorders, which is critical for the study of disease biology. Thus, DISC1 may have the potential to not only point us in the direction of novel drug targets but also provide more relevant animal models for compound testing.
18055445	Constitutive expression of the ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCG2 enhances the growth potential of early human hematopoietic progenitors.	The ATP-binding cassette transporter, ABCG2, is a molecular determinant of the side population phenotype, which is enriched for stem and progenitor cells in various nonhematopoietic and hematopoietic tissues. ABCG2 is highly expressed in hematopoietic progenitors and silenced in differentiated hematopoietic cells, suggesting a role of ABCG2 in early hematopoiesis. To test whether ABCG2 is involved in human hematopoietic development, we retrovirally transduced umbilical cord blood-derived early hematopoietic cells and analyzed hematopoiesis in vitro and in vivo. ABCG2 increased the number of clonogenic progenitors in vitro, including the most primitive colony-forming unit-granulocyte, erythroid, macrophage, megakaryocyte, by twofold (n = 14; p < .0005). Furthermore, ABCG2 induced a threefold increase in the replating capacity of primary colonies (n = 9; p < .01). In addition, ABCG2 impaired the development of CD19+ lymphoid cells in vitro. In transplanted NOD/SCID mice, the ATP-binding cassette transporter decreased the number of human B-lymphoid cells, resulting in an inversion of the lymphoid/myeloid ratio. ABCG2 enhanced the proportion of CD34+ progenitor cells in vivo (n = 4; p < .05) and enhanced the most primitive human progenitor pool, as determined by limiting dilution competitive repopulating unit assay (p < .034). Our data characterize ABCG2 as a regulatory protein of early human hematopoietic development.
18055454	Sphingosine kinase 1 is up-regulated during hypoxia in U87MG glioma cells. Role of hypoxia-inducible factors 1 and 2.	Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a sphingolipid metabolite that plays an important role in the regulation of cell survival, growth, migration, and angiogenesis, acts both inside the cells and as an extracellular mediator through binding to five G protein-coupled receptors (S1P(1-5)). Sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1), the enzyme responsible for S1P production, is overexpressed in many solid tumors, including gliomas. One common feature of these tumors is the presence of "hypoxic regions," characterized by cells expressing high levels of hypoxia-inducible factors HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha, two transcription regulators that modulate the levels of proteins with crucial roles in tumor progression. So far, nothing is known about the role and the regulation of SK1 during tumor-induced hypoxia or about SK1 regulation and HIFs. Here we investigated the role of HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha in the regulation of SK1 during hypoxic stress in glioma-derived U87MG cells. We report that hypoxia increases SK1 mRNA levels, protein expression, and enzyme activity, followed by intracellular S1P production and S1P release. Interestingly, knockdown of HIF-2alpha by small interfering RNA abolished the induction of SK1 and the production of extracellular S1P after CoCl(2) treatment, whereas HIF-1alpha small interfering RNA resulted in an increase of HIF-2alpha and of SK1 protein levels. Moreover, using chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, we demonstrate that HIF-2alpha binds the SK1 promoter. Functionally, we demonstrate that conditioned medium from hypoxia-treated tumor cells results in neoangiogenesis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells in a S1P receptor-dependent manner. These studies provide evidence of a link between S1P production as a potent angiogenic agent and the hypoxic phenotype observed in many tumors.
18055475	A modified Delphi exercise to determine the extent of consensus with OMERACT outcome domains for studies of acute and chronic gout.	OBJECTIVES: To reach consensus with recommendations made by an OMERACT Special Interest Group (SIG). METHODS: Rheumatologists and industry representatives interested in gout rated and clarified, in three iterations, the importance of domains proposed by the OMERACT SIG for use in acute and chronic gout intervention studies. Consensus was defined as a value of less than 1 of the UCLA/RAND disagreement index. RESULTS: There were 33 respondents (61% response rate); all agreed the initial items were necessary, except "total body urate pool". Additional domains were suggested and clarification sought for defining "joint inflammation" and "musculoskeletal function". Items that demonstrated no clear decision were re-rated in the final iteration. There were six highly rated items (rating 1-2) with four slightly lower rating items (rating 3) for acute gout; and 11 highly rated items with eight slightly lower ratings for chronic gout. CONCLUSIONS: Consensus is that the following domains be considered mandatory for acute gout studies: pain, joint swelling, joint tenderness, patient global, physician global, functional disability; and for chronic gout studies: serum urate, gout flares, tophus regression, health-related quality of life, functional disability, pain, patient global, physician global, work disability and joint inflammation. Several additional domains were considered discretionary.
18055479	Putative promoter regions of miRNA genes involved in evolutionarily conserved regulatory systems among vertebrates.	MOTIVATION: Just as transcription factors, miRNA genes modulate global patterns of gene expression during differentiation, metabolic activation, stimulus response and also carcinogenesis. However, little is currently known how the miRNA gene expression itself is regulated owing to lack of basic information of their gene structure. Global prediction of promoter regions of miRNA genes would allow us to explore the mechanisms underlying gene-regulatory mechanisms involving these miRNAs. RESULTS: We speculate that if specific miRNA molecules are involved in evolutionarily conserved regulatory systems in vertebrates, this would entail a high level of conservation of the promoter of miRNA gene as well as the miRNA molecule. By our current screening of putative promoter regions of miRNA genes (miPPRs) on this base, we identified 59 miPPRs that would direct production of 79 miRNAs. We present both biochemical and bioinformatical verifications of these putative promoters.
18055499	Alternative splicing and protein structure evolution.	Alternative splicing is thought to be one of the major sources for functional diversity in higher eukaryotes. Interestingly, when mapping splicing events onto protein structures, about half of the events affect structured and even highly conserved regions i.e. are non-trivial on the structure level. This has led to the controversial hypothesis that such splice variants result in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay or non-functional, unstructured proteins, which do not contribute to the functional diversity of an organism. Here we show in a comprehensive study on alternative splicing that proteins appear to be much more tolerant to structural deletions, insertions and replacements than previously thought. We find literature evidence that such non-trivial splicing isoforms exhibit different functional properties compared to their native counterparts and allow for interesting regulatory patterns on the protein network level. We provide examples that splicing events may represent transitions between different folds in the protein sequence-structure space and explain these links by a common genetic mechanism. Taken together, those findings hint to a more prominent role of splicing in protein structure evolution and to a different view of phenotypic plasticity of protein structures.
18055584	Core genome responses involved in acclimation to high temperature.	Plants can acclimate rapidly to environmental conditions, including high temperatures. To identify molecular events important for acquired thermotolerance, we compared viability and transcript profiles of Arabidopsis thaliana treated to severe heat stress (45 degrees C) without acclimation or following two different acclimation treatments. Notably, a gradual increase to 45 degrees C (22 degrees C to 45 degrees C over 6 h) led to higher survival and to more and higher-fold transcript changes than a step-wise acclimation (90 min at 38 degrees C plus 120 min at 22 degrees C before 45 degrees C). There were significant differences in the total spectrum of transcript changes in the two treatments, but core components of heat acclimation were apparent in the overlap between treatments, emphasizing the importance of performing transcriptome analysis in the context of physiological response. In addition to documenting increases in transcripts of specific genes involved in processes predicted to be required for thermotolerance (i.e. protection of proteins and of translation, limiting oxidative stress), we also found decreases in transcripts (i.e. for programmed cell death, basic metabolism, and biotic stress responses), which are likely equally important for acclimation. Similar protective effects may also be achieved differently, such as prevention of proline accumulation, which is toxic at elevated temperatures and which was reduced by both acclimation treatments but was associated with transcript changes predicted to either reduce proline synthesis or increase degradation in the two acclimation treatments. Finally, phenotypic analysis of T-DNA insertion mutants of genes identified in this analysis defined eight new genes involved in heat acclimation, including cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase and the transcription factors HsfA7a (heat shock transcription factor A7a) and NF-X1.
18055587	UV-B signaling pathways with different fluence-rate response profiles are distinguished in mature Arabidopsis leaf tissue by requirement for UVR8, HY5, and HYH.	UV-B signaling is an important but poorly understood aspect of light responsiveness in plants. Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) UV RESISTANCE LOCUS8 (UVR8) is a recently identified UV-B-specific signaling component that regulates UV-protective responses. Using the uvr8 mutant, we defined genetically distinct UVR8-dependent and UVR8-independent pathways that stimulate different sets of genes in mature Arabidopsis leaf tissue. Both pathways operate at 1 micromol m(-2) s(-1) UV-B and above, but the UVR8-dependent pathway is able to stimulate UV-protective genes even in response to 0.1 micromol m(-2) s(-1) UV-B. Both pathways function in mutants lacking phytochromes, cryptochromes, or phototropins. Genes encoding the ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5) and HY5 HOMOLOG (HYH) transcription factors are induced at low UV-B fluence rates (0.1 micromol m(-2) s(-1)). Experiments with hy5 and hyh mutants reveal that both these factors mediate responses of the UVR8-dependent pathway, acting with partial or complete redundancy to stimulate expression of particular genes. Furthermore, evidence is presented that all UVR8 pathway genes are likely to be regulated by HY5/HYH and that these transcription factors do not mediate UV-B responses independent of UVR8. Finally, we highlight the functions of HY5 and HYH in UV protection and show that HY5 plays the more critical role. This research provides evidence that, in UV-B signaling, UVR8, HY5, and HYH act together in a photoregulatory pathway and demonstrates a new role for HYH in UV-B responses.
18055593	Reduced apo-fumarate nitrate reductase regulator (apoFNR) as the major form of FNR in aerobically growing Escherichia coli.	Under anoxic conditions, the Escherichia coli oxygen sensor FNR (fumarate nitrate reductase regulator) is in the active state and contains a [4Fe-4S] cluster. Oxygen converts [4Fe-4S]FNR to inactive [2Fe-2S]FNR. After prolonged exposure to air in vitro, apoFNR lacking a Fe-S cluster is formed. ApoFNR can be differentiated from Fe-S-containing forms by the accessibility of the five Cys thiol residues, four of which serve as ligands for the Fe-S cluster. The presence of apoFNR in aerobically and anaerobically grown E. coli was analyzed in situ using thiol reagents. In anaerobically and aerobically grown cells, the membrane-permeable monobromobimane labeled one to two and four Cys residues, respectively; the same labeling pattern was found with impermeable thiol reagents after cell permeabilization. Alkylation of FNR in aerobic bacteria and counting the labeled residues by mass spectrometry showed a form of FNR with five accessible Cys residues, corresponding to apoFNR with all Cys residues in the thiol state. Therefore, aerobically growing cells contain apoFNR, whereas a significant amount of Fe-S-containing FNR was not detected under these conditions. Exposure of anaerobic bacteria to oxygen caused conversion of Fe-S-containing FNR to apoFNR within 6 min. ApoFNR from aerobic bacteria contained no disulfide, in contrast to apoFNR formed in vitro by air inactivation, and all Cys residues were in the thiol form.
18055865	Multicenter phase 3 study of the complement inhibitor eculizumab for the treatment of patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.	The terminal complement inhibitor eculizumab was recently shown to be effective and well tolerated in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). Here, we extended these observations with results from an open-label, non-placebo-controlled, 52-week, phase 3 clinical safety and efficacy study evaluating eculizumab in a broader PNH patient population. Eculizumab was administered by intravenous infusion at 600 mg every 7 +/- 2 days for 4 weeks; 900 mg 7 +/- 2 days later; followed by 900 mg every 14 +/- 2 days for a total treatment period of 52 weeks. Ninety-seven patients at 33 international sites were enrolled. Patients treated with eculizumab responded with an 87% reduction in hemolysis, as measured by lactate dehydrogenase levels (P < .001). Baseline fatigue scores in the FACIT-Fatigue instrument improved by 12.2 +/- 1.1 points (P < .001). Eculizumab treatment led to an improvement in anemia. The increase in hemoglobin level occurred despite a reduction in transfusion requirements from a median of 8.0 units of packed red cells per patient before treatment to 0.0 units per patient during the study (P < .001). Overall, transfusions were reduced 52% from a mean of 12.3 to 5.9 units of packed red cells per patient. Forty-nine patients (51%) achieved transfusion independence for the entire 52-week period. Improvements in hemolysis, fatigue, and transfusion requirements with eculizumab were independent of baseline levels of hemolysis and degree of thrombocytopenia. Quality of life measures were also broadly improved with eculizumab treatment. This study demonstrates that the beneficial effects of eculizumab treatment in patients with PNH are applicable to a broader population of PNH patients than previously studied. This trial is registered at http://clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00130000.
18056062	Déjà vu--a study of duplicate citations in Medline.	MOTIVATION: Duplicate publication impacts the quality of the scientific corpus, has been difficult to detect, and studies this far have been limited in scope and size. Using text similarity searches, we were able to identify signatures of duplicate citations among a body of abstracts. RESULTS: A sample of 62,213 Medline citations was examined and a database of manually verified duplicate citations was created to study author publication behavior. We found that 0.04% of the citations with no shared authors were highly similar and are thus potential cases of plagiarism. 1.35% with shared authors were sufficiently similar to be considered a duplicate. Extrapolating, this would correspond to 3500 and 117,500 duplicate citations in total, respectively. AVAILABILITY: eTBLAST, an automated citation matching tool, and Déjà vu, the duplicate citation database, are freely available at http://invention.swmed.edu/ and http://spore.swmed.edu/dejavu

MOTIVATION: To clarify the semantics, and take advantage of tools and algorithms developed for the Semantic Web, a mapping from the Open Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) format to the Web Ontology Language (OWL) has been established. We present an ontology editor that allows end users to work directly with this OWL representation of OBO format ontologies. AVAILABILITY: http://www.aiai.ed.ac.uk/project/cobra-ct.
18056086	How cognition modulates affective responses to taste and flavor: top-down influences on the orbitofrontal and pregenual cingulate cortices.	How cognition influences the affective brain representations of the taste and flavor of a food is important not only for understanding top-down influences in the brain, but also in relation to the topical issues of appetite control and obesity. We found using functional magnetic resonance imaging that activations related to the affective value of umami taste and flavor (as shown by correlations with pleasantness ratings) in the orbitofrontal cortex were modulated by word-level descriptors. Affect-related activations to taste were modulated in a region that receives from the orbitofrontal cortex, the pregenual cingulate cortex, and to taste and flavor in another region that receives from the orbitofrontal cortex, the ventral striatum. Affect-related cognitive modulations were not found in the insular taste cortex, where the intensity but not the pleasantness of the taste was represented. We conclude that top-down language-level cognitive effects reach far down into the earliest cortical areas that represent the appetitive value of taste and flavor. This is an important way in which cognition influences the neural mechanisms that control appetite.
18056481	The IL-4Ralpha pathway in macrophages and its potential role in silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis.	Crystalline silica exposure can result in pulmonary fibrosis, where the pulmonary macrophage is key as a result of its ability to react to silica particles. In the mouse silicosis model, there is initial Th1-type inflammation, characterized by TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma. Previous studies determined that Th2 mediators (i.e., IL-13) are vital to development of pulmonary fibrosis. The present study, using in vivo and in vitro techniques, compares silica exposures between Balb/c and Th2-deficient mice in an effort to determine the link between Th2 immunity and silicosis. In long-term experiments, a significant increase in fibrosis and activated interstitial macrophages was observed in Balb/c but not IL-4Ralpha(-/-) mice. Additionally, a significant increase in Ym1 mRNA levels, a promoter of Th2 immunity, was determined in the interstitial leukocyte population of silica-exposed Balb/c mice. To elucidate the effects of silica on macrophage function, bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMdM) were exposed to particles and assayed for T cell (TC) stimulation activity. As a control, Ym1 mRNA expression in Balb/c BMdM was determined using IL-4 stimulation. In the in vitro assay, a significant increase in TC activation, as defined by surface markers and cytokines, was observed in the cultures containing the silica-exposed macrophages in wild-type and IL-4Ralpha(-/-) mice, with one exception: IL-4Ralpha(-/-) BMdM were unable to induce an increase in IL-13. These results suggest that crystalline silica alters cellular functions of macrophages, including activation of TC, and that the increase in Th2 immunity associated with silicosis is via the IL-4Ralpha-Ym1 pathway.
18056687	Robust combination of multiple diagnostic tests for classifying censored event times.	Recent advancement in technology promises to yield a multitude of tests for disease diagnosis and prognosis. When there are multiple sources of information available, it is often of interest to construct a composite score that can provide better classification accuracy than any individual measurement. In this paper, we consider robust procedures for optimally combining tests when test results are measured prior to disease onset and disease status evolves over time. To account for censoring of disease onset time, the most commonly used approach to combining tests to detect subsequent disease status is to fit a proportional hazards model (Cox, 1972) and use the estimated risk score. However, simulation studies suggested that such a risk score may have poor accuracy when the proportional hazards assumption fails. We propose the use of a nonparametric transformation model (Han, 1987) as a working model to derive an optimal composite score with theoretical justification. We demonstrate that the proposed score is the optimal score when the model holds and is optimal "on average" among linear scores even if the model fails. Time-dependent sensitivity, specificity, and receiver operating characteristic curve functions are used to quantify the accuracy of the resulting composite score. We provide consistent and asymptotically Gaussian estimators of these accuracy measures. A simple model-free resampling procedure is proposed to obtain all consistent variance estimators. We illustrate the new proposals with simulation studies and an analysis of a breast cancer gene expression data set.
18056692	Partial trisomy of 7q: case report and literature review.	This case describes a boy with pure partial trisomy of the long arm of chromosome 7. The only prenatal finding on the boy was cerebral ventricular enlargement. After birth, mild facial dysmorphic features and cardiac malformations (pulmonary valve dysplasia, interatrial and interventricular septal defects) were detected. The boy developed severe psychomotor retardation, failure to thrive, and poor interaction with the environment. Focal seizures occurred in the neonatal period. Left frontotemporal abnormalities were observed in the subsequent electroencephalograms. An area of subependymal nodular heterotopia in the right frontal region was detected. Eighteen cases of 7q pure trisomy have been described in the literature over the years. The present study confirms that, in 7q trisomy cases, there are several common, yet nonspecific, features: macrocephaly, frontal bossing, failure to thrive, psychomotor delay, low-set ears, short neck, and genital-urinary tract abnormalities. Shortened life span seems associated only with duplication of the entire arm, and correlation phenotype-genotype seems questionable.
18056715	Nitrite reductase activity of hemoglobin S (sickle) provides insight into contributions of heme redox potential versus ligand affinity.	Hemoglobin A (HbA) is an allosterically regulated nitrite reductase that reduces nitrite to NO under physiological hypoxia. The efficiency of this reaction is modulated by two intrinsic and opposing properties: availability of unliganded ferrous hemes and R-state character of the hemoglobin tetramer. Nitrite is reduced by deoxygenated ferrous hemes, such that heme deoxygenation increases the rate of NO generation. However, heme reactivity with nitrite, represented by its bimolecular rate constant, is greatest when the tetramer is in the R quaternary state. The mechanism underlying the higher reactivity of R-state hemes remains elusive. It can be due to the lower heme redox potential of R-state ferrous hemes or could reflect the high ligand affinity geometry of R-state tetramers that facilitates nitrite binding. We evaluated the nitrite reductase activity of unpolymerized sickle hemoglobin (HbS), whose oxygen affinity and cooperativity profile are equal to those of HbA, but whose heme iron has a lower redox potential. We now report that HbS exhibits allosteric nitrite reductase activity with competing proton and redox Bohr effects. In addition, we found that solution phase HbS reduces nitrite to NO significantly faster than HbA, supporting the thesis that heme electronics (i.e. redox potential) contributes to the high reactivity of R-state deoxy-hemes with nitrite. From a pathophysiological standpoint, under conditions where HbS polymers form, the rate of nitrite reduction is reduced compared with HbA and solution-phase HbS, indicating that HbS polymers reduce nitrite more slowly.
18056836	Hematopoiesis and immunity of HOXB4-transduced embryonic stem cell-derived hematopoietic progenitor cells.	The ability of embryonic stem (ES) cells to form cells and tissues from all 3 germ layers can be exploited to generate cells that can be used to treat diseases. In particular, successful generation of hematopoietic cells from ES cells could provide safer and less immunogenic cells than bone marrow cells, which require severe host preconditioning when transplanted across major histocompatibility complex barriers. Here, we exploited the self-renewal properties of ectopically expressed HOXB4, a homeobox transcription factor, to generate hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) that successfully induce high-level mixed chimerism and long-term engraftment in recipient mice. The HPCs partially restored splenic architecture in Rag2(-/-)gamma(c)(-/-)-immunodeficient mice. In addition, HPC-derived newly generated T cells were able to mount a peptide-specific response to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus and specifically secreted interleukin-2 and interferon-gamma upon CD3 stimulation. In addition, HPC-derived antigen presenting cells in chimeric mice efficiently presented viral antigen to wild-type T cells. These results demonstrate for the first time that leukocytes derived from ES cells ectopically expressing HOXB4 are immunologically functional, opening up new opportunities for the use of ES cell-derived HPCs in the treatment of hematologic and immunologic diseases.
18056837	Soluble MD-2 is an acute-phase protein and an opsonin for Gram-negative bacteria.	Myeloid differentiation factor-2 (MD-2) is a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding protein usually coexpressed with and binding to Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), conferring LPS responsiveness of immune cells. MD-2 is also found as a soluble protein. Soluble MD-2 (sMD-2) levels are markedly elevated in plasma from patients with severe infections, and in other fluids from inflamed tissues. We show that sMD-2 is a type II acute-phase protein. Soluble MD-2 mRNA and protein levels are up-regulated in mouse liver after the induction of an acute-phase response. It is secreted by human hepatocytic cells and up-regulated by interleukin-6. Soluble MD-2 binds to Gram-negative but not Gram-positive bacteria, and sMD-2 secreted by hepatocytic cells is an essential cofactor for the activation of TLR4-expressing cells by Gram-negative bacteria. Soluble MD-2 opsonization of Gram-negative bacteria accelerates and enhances phagocytosis, principally by polymorphonuclear neutrophils. In summary, our results demonstrate that sMD-2 is a newly recognized type II acute-phase reactant, an opsonin for Gram-negative bacteria, and a cofactor essential for the activation of TLR4-expressing cells. This suggests that sMD-2 plays a key role in the host innate immune response to Gram-negative infections.
18056841	BCL-2 dependence and ABT-737 sensitivity in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.	Cancer cells acquire disruptions in normal signal transduction pathways and homeostatic mechanisms that would trigger apoptosis in normal cells. These abnormalities include genomic instability, oncogene activation, and growth factor independent proliferation. Therefore, cancer cells likely require a block in apoptosis in order to survive. Overexpression of the antiapoptotic protein BCL-2 provides a block in apoptosis that is frequently observed in cancer cells. We have developed methods for the detection and analysis of BCL-2 dependence and here apply them to acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). BH3 profiling, a mitochondrial assay that classifies blocks in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, indicated a dependence on BCL-2 of both ALL cell lines and primary samples. This dependence predicted that BCL-2 would be complexed with select pro-death BH3 family proteins, a prediction confirmed by the isolation of BCL-2 complexes with BIM. Furthermore, the BH3 profiling and protein analysis predicted that ALL cell lines and primary cells would be sensitive to ABT-737 as a single agent. Finally, BH3 profiling and protein studies accurately predicted a relative degree of sensitivity to BCL-2 antagonism in cell lines. The ALL cells studied exhibit BCL-2 dependence, supporting clinical trials of BCL-2 antagonists in ALL as single agents or combination therapies.
18056843	Effective and selective inhibition of chronic myeloid leukemia primitive hematopoietic progenitors by the dual Src/Abl kinase inhibitor SKI-606.	Imatinib mesylate (imatinib) is highly effective in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) but is less effective in eliminating CML stem cells. We investigated whether SKI-606, a potent Bcr-Abl and Src kinase inhibitor without anti-PDGF or c-Kit activity, could effectively target primitive CML progenitors. CML and normal progenitors were cultured with SKI-606 or imatinib. SKI-606 effectively inhibited Bcr-Abl kinase activity in CML CD34(+) cells and inhibited Src phosphorylation more potently than imatinib. However, SKI-606 and imatinib resulted in similar suppression of CML primitive and committed progenitor proliferation and growth in CFC and LTC-IC assays. Exposure to either agent alone or in combination resulted in only modest increase in apoptosis. Evaluation of downstream signaling pathways indicated that Akt and STAT5 activity was not changed, but a delayed increase in MAPK activity was seen at high concentrations of SKI-606. SKI-606 inhibited normal progenitor proliferation to a lesser extent than imatinib. SKI-606 effectively inhibits Bcr-Abl and Src kinase activity and inhibits CML progenitor growth with relatively little effect on normal progenitors. However, SKI-606 does not demonstrate increased ability to eliminate primitive CML progenitors by apoptosis compared with imatinib, emphasizing the need for additional strategies besides Bcr-Abl kinase inhibition for curative therapy of CML.
18056918	Low potency of Chlamydophila LPS to activate human mononuclear cells due to its reduced affinities for CD14 and LPS-binding protein.	Chlamydiaceae are small obligate intracellular parasites and classified as Gram-negative bacteria. Among Chlamydiaceae-derived components, LPS is known as an immunomodulator and possesses a unique lipid A structure with longer but fewer acyl chains. In this study, to elucidate the Chlamydiaceae-induced immune responses, we evaluated the actions of Chlamydophila psittaci LPS as a Chlamydiaceae LPS on human PBMCs and compared with those of Escherichia coli LPS. Similar to E. coli LPS, C. psittaci LPS bound to monocytes and induced the pro-inflammatory cytokine production in an LPS-binding protein (LBP)-dependent manner. However, C. psittaci LPS was much less potent than E. coli LPS in both the LPS binding and cytokine production. Interestingly, although the binding of C. psittaci LPS was mediated by CD14, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and CD11b, CD14 and TLR4 but not CD11b were involved in the cytokine production. Of note, ELISA-based binding assays revealed that C. psittaci LPS directly bound to LBP and CD14; however, the affinities were much less than those of E. coli LPS. Together, these observations possibly suggest that Chlamydiaceae LPS has low binding affinities for LPS recognition molecules such as CD14 and LBP and exhibit weak biological activities against host immune cells including monocytes, thereby contributing to the chronic (persistent) inflammatory reactions during infection.
18056988	Animal type 1 cryptochromes. Analysis of the redox state of the flavin cofactor by site-directed mutagenesis.	It has recently been realized that animal cryptochromes (CRYs) fall into two broad groups. Type 1 CRYs, the prototype of which is the Drosophila CRY, that is known to be a circadian photoreceptor. Type 2 CRYs, the prototypes of which are human CRY 1 and CRY 2, are known to function as core clock proteins. The mechanism of photosignaling by the Type 1 CRYs is not well understood. We recently reported that the flavin cofactor of the Type 1 CRY of the monarch butterfly may be in the form of flavin anion radical, FAD(*-), in vivo. Here we describe the purification and characterization of wild-type and mutant forms of Type 1 CRYs from fruit fly, butterfly, mosquito, and silk moth. Cryptochromes from all four sources contain FAD(ox) when purified, and the flavin is readily reduced to FAD(*-) by light. Interestingly, mutations that block photoreduction in vitro do not affect the photoreceptor activities of these CRYs, but mutations that reduce the stability of FAD(*-) in vitro abolish the photoreceptor function of Type 1 CRYs in vivo. Collectively, our data provide strong evidence for functional similarities of Type 1 CRYs across insect species and further support the proposal that FAD(*-) represents the ground state and not the excited state of the flavin cofactor in Type 1 CRYs.
18057003	The role of CXCR7/RDC1 as a chemokine receptor for CXCL12/SDF-1 in prostate cancer.	Several reports have recently documented that CXCR7/RDC1 functions as a chemokine receptor for SDF-1/CXCL12, which regulates a spectrum of normal and pathological processes. In this study, the role of CXCR7/RDC1 in prostate cancer (PCa) was explored. Staining of high density tissue microarrays demonstrates that the levels of CXCR7/RDC1 expression increase as the tumors become more aggressive. In vitro and in vivo studies with PCa cell lines suggest that alterations in CXCR7/RDC1 expression are associated with enhanced adhesive and invasive activities in addition to a survival advantage. In addition, it was observed that CXCR7/RDC1 levels are regulated by CXCR4. Among the potential downstream targets of CXCR7/RDC1 are CD44 and cadherin-11, which are likely to contribute to the invasiveness of PCa cells. CXCR7/RDC1 also regulates the expression of the proangiogenic factors interleukin-8 or vascular endothelial growth factor, which are likely to participate in the regulation of tumor angiogenesis. Finally, we found that signaling by CXCR7/RDC1 activates AKT pathways. Together, these data demonstrate a role for CXCR7/RDC1 in PCa metastasis and progression and suggest potential targets for therapeutic intervention.
18057019	Mutual information without the influence of phylogeny or entropy dramatically improves residue contact prediction.	MOTIVATION: Compensating alterations during the evolution of protein families give rise to coevolving positions that contain important structural and functional information. However, a high background composed of random noise and phylogenetic components interferes with the identification of coevolving positions. RESULTS: We have developed a rapid, simple and general method based on information theory that accurately estimates the level of background mutual information for each pair of positions in a given protein family. Removal of this background results in a metric, MIp, that correctly identifies substantially more coevolving positions in protein families than any existing method. A significant fraction of these positions coevolve strongly with one or only a few positions. The vast majority of such position pairs are in contact in representative structures. The identification of strongly coevolving position pairs can be used to impose significant structural limitations and should be an important additional constraint for ab initio protein folding. AVAILABILITY: Alignments and program files can be found in the Supplementary Information.
18057104	Crucial role of antisense transcription across the Xist promoter in Tsix-mediated Xist chromatin modification.	Expression of Xist, which triggers X inactivation, is negatively regulated in cis by an antisense gene, Tsix, transcribed along the entire Xist gene. We recently demonstrated that Tsix silences Xist through modification of the chromatin structure in the Xist promoter region. This finding prompted us to investigate the role of antisense transcription across the Xist promoter in Tsix-mediated silencing. Here, we prematurely terminated Tsix transcription before the Xist promoter and addressed its effect on Xist silencing in mouse embryos. We found that although 93% of the region encoding Tsix was transcribed, truncation of Tsix abolished the antisense regulation of Xist. This resulted in a failure to establish the repressive chromatin configuration at the Xist promoter on the mutated X, including DNA methylation and repressive histone modifications, especially in extraembryonic tissues. These results suggest a crucial role for antisense transcription across the Xist promoter in Xist silencing.
18057113	Preconditioning repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation of premotor cortex can reduce but not enhance short-term facilitation of primary motor cortex.	Short trains of suprathreshold 5-Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over primary motor cortex (M1) evoke motor potentials (MEPs) in hand muscles that progressively increase in amplitude via a mechanism that is thought to be similar to short-term potentiation described in animal preparations. Long trains of subthreshold rTMS over dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) are known to affect the amplitude of single-pulse MEPs evoked from M1. We tested whether PMd-rTMS affects short-term facilitation in M1. We also explored the effect of PMd-rTMS on M1 responses evoked by single-pulse TMS of different polarities. We tested in 15 healthy subjects short-term facilitation in left M1 (10 suprathreshold TMS pulses at 5 Hz) after applying rTMS to left PMd (1,500 subthreshold pulses at 1 and 5 Hz). In a sample of subjects we delivered single-pulse TMS with different polarities and paired-pulse TMS at short intervals (SICI) after PMd-rTMS. Short-term facilitation in M1 was reduced after applying 1 Hz to PMd, but was unaffected after 5-Hz PMd-rTMS. PMd-rTMS with 1 Hz reduced the amplitude of MEPs evoked by monophasic posteroanterior (PA) or biphasic anteroposterior (AP)-PA but had little effect on MEPs by monophasic AP or biphasic PA-AP single-pulse TMS. PMd-rTMS left SICI unchanged. PMd-rTMS (1 Hz) reduces short-term facilitation in M1 induced by short 5-Hz trains. This effect is likely to be caused by reduced facilitation of I-wave inputs to corticospinal neurons.
18057535	GPR87 is an overexpressed G-protein coupled receptor in squamous cell carcinoma of the lung.	Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. The overall 5-year survival after therapy is about 16% and there is a clear need for better treatment options, such as therapies targeting specific molecular structures. G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), as the largest family of cell surface receptors, represent an important group of potential targets for diagnostics and therapy. We therefore used laser capture microdissection and GPCR-focused Affymetrix microarrays to examine the expression of 929 GPCR transcripts in tissue samples of 10 patients with squamous cell carcinoma and 7 with adenocarcinoma in order to identify novel targets in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). The relative gene expression levels were calculated in tumour samples compared to samples of the neighbouring alveolar tissue in every patient. Based on this unique study design, we identified 5 significantly overexpressed GPCRs in squamous cell carcinoma, in the following decreasing order of expression: GPR87 > CMKOR1 > FZD10 > LGR4 > P2RY11. All are non-olfactory and GRAFS (glutamate, rhodopsin, adhesion, frizzled/taste2, secretin family) classified. GPR87, LGR4 and CMKOR1 are orphan receptors. GPR87 stands out as a candidate for further target validation due to its marked overexpression and correlation on a mutation-based level to squamous cell carcinoma.
18057949	Multiple mechanisms of chromosome movement in vertebrate cells mediated through the Ndc80 complex and dynein/dynactin.	Kinetochores bind microtubules laterally in a transient fashion and stably, by insertion of plus ends. These pathways may exist to carry out distinct tasks during different stages of mitosis and likely depend on distinct molecular mechanisms. On isolated chromosomes, we found microtubule nucleation/binding depended additively on both dynein/dynactin and on the Ndc80/Hec1 complex. Studying chromosome movement in living Xenopus cells within the simplified geometry of monopolar spindles, we quantified the relative contributions of dynein/dynactin and the Ndc80/Hec1 complex. Inhibition of dynein/dynactin alone had minor effects but did suppress transient, rapid, poleward movements. In contrast, inhibition of the Ndc80 complex blocked normal end-on attachments of microtubules to kinetochores resulting in persistent rapid poleward movements that required dynein/dynactin. In normal cells with bipolar spindles, dynein/dynactin activity on its own allowed attachment and rapid movement of chromosomes on prometaphase spindles but failed to support metaphase alignment and chromatid movement in anaphase. Thus, in prometaphase, dynein/dynactin likely mediates early transient, lateral interactions of kinetochores and microtubules. However, mature attachment via the Ndc80 complex is essential for metaphase alignment and anaphase A.
18057950	Expression and localization of PMCA4 in rat testis and epididymis.	It has recently been shown in mice that the plasma membrane Ca(2+)-ATPase isoform 4 (PMCA4) is essential for sperm fertilization capacity. We analyzed whether sperm PMCA4 is formed in the rat during spermatogenesis or is synthesized in the epididymis and transferred onto sperm during sperm maturation. We could show that PMCA4 is conserved in sperm from testis to epididymis. In testis, PMCA4 mRNA was restricted to spermatogonia and early spermatocytes, while the PMCA4 protein was detected in spermatogonia, late spermatocytes, spermatids and in epididymal sperm. In epididymis PMCA4 mRNA was localized in basolateral plasma membranes of epithelial cells of the caput, corpus and cauda epididymidis. In contrast, the protein was only detectable in the epithelial cells of the caput, indicating that PMCA4 mRNA is only translated into protein in caput epithelium. In the epididymal corpus and cauda, PMCA4 mRNA and protein, respectively, was localized and in peritubular cells. Furthermore, we detected an identical distribution of PMCA4a and b splice variants in rat testis, epididymal corpus and cauda. In the caput epididymidis, where PMCA4 is located in the epithelium splice variant 4b was more prominent. Further experiments have to clarify the functional importance of the differences in the PMCA4 distribution.
18058107	Diagnostic efficacy of gadoxetic acid (Primovist)-enhanced MRI and spiral CT for a therapeutic strategy: comparison with intraoperative and histopathologic findings in focal liver lesions.	A multicenter study has been employed to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using the new liver-specific contrast agent gadoxetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA, Primovist), as opposed to contrast-enhanced biphasic spiral computed tomography (CT), in the diagnosis of focal liver lesions, compared with a standard of reference (SOR). One hundred and sixty-nine patients with hepatic lesions eligible for surgery underwent Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI as well as CT within 6 weeks. Pathologic evaluation of the liver specimen combined with intraoperative ultrasound established the SOR. Data sets were evaluated on-site (14 investigators) and off-site (three independent blinded readers). Gd-EOB-DTPA was well tolerated. Three hundred and two lesions were detected in 131 patients valid for analysis by SOR. The frequency of correctly detected lesions was significantly higher on Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI compared with CT in the clinical evaluation [10.44%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 4.88, 16.0]. In the blinded reading there was a trend towards Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI, not reaching statistical significance (2.14%; 95% CI: -4.32, 8.6). However, the highest rate of correctly detected lesions with a diameter below 1 cm was achieved by Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI. Differential diagnosis was superior for Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI (82.1%) versus CT (71.0%). A change in surgical therapy was documented in 19 of 131 patients (14.5%) post Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI. Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI was superior in the diagnosis and therapeutic management of focal liver lesions compared with CT.
18058382	Two new isoflavone triglycosides from the small branches of Sophora japonica.	Two new isoflavone triglycosides, genistein 4'-O-(6''-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl)-beta-sophoroside (1), and genistein 4'-O-(6'''-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl)-beta-sophoroside (2), together with five known compounds, namely, sophorabioside, genistin, rutin, quercetin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside, and kaempferol 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside, were isolated from the small branches of Sophora japonica L. Their structures were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic analyses and chemical evidence.
18058764	Capillary electrophoresis of proteins 2005-2007.	This review article with 239 references describes recent developments in capillary electrophoresis of proteins, and covers the two years since the previous review (V. Dolník, Electrophoresis 2006, 27, 126-141) through spring 2007. It includes topics related to CE of proteins, such as sample pretreatment, wall coatings, improving separation, various forms of detection, and special electrophoretic techniques including ACE, CIEF, capillary ITP, and CEC. The paper describes applications of CE to analysis of proteins in real-world samples including human body fluids, food and agricultural samples, protein pharmaceuticals and recombinant protein preparations.
18058796	Profiling of copy number variations (CNVs) in healthy individuals from three ethnic groups using a human genome 32 K BAC-clone-based array.	To further explore the extent of structural large-scale variation in the human genome, we assessed copy number variations (CNVs) in a series of 71 healthy subjects from three ethnic groups. CNVs were analyzed using comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to a BAC array covering the human genome, using DNA extracted from peripheral blood, thus avoiding any culture-induced rearrangements. By applying a newly developed computational algorithm based on Hidden Markov modeling, we identified 1,078 autosomal CNVs, including at least two neighboring/overlapping BACs, which represent 315 distinct regions. The average size of the sequence polymorphisms was approximately 350 kb and involved in total approximately 117 Mb or approximately 3.5% of the genome. Gains were about four times more common than deletions, and segmental duplications (SDs) were overrepresented, especially in larger deletion variants. This strengthens the notion that SDs often define hotspots of chromosomal rearrangements. Over 60% of the identified autosomal rearrangements match previously reported CNVs, recognized with various platforms. However, results from chromosome X do not agree well with the previously annotated CNVs. Furthermore, data from single BACs deviating in copy number suggest that our above estimate of total variation is conservative. This report contributes to the establishment of the common baseline for CNV, which is an important resource in human genetics.
18058842	Predictive value of angiogenic factors and uterine artery Doppler for early- versus late-onset pre-eclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction.	OBJECTIVES: To investigate potential differences in the prediction of early- vs. late-onset pre-eclampsia and/or intrauterine growth restriction (PE/IUGR) by second-trimester uterine artery Doppler examination, and measurement of maternal serum placental growth factor (PlGF) and soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt1). METHODS: Uterine artery mean pulsatility index (PI) and maternal serum PlGF and sFlt1 levels were measured at 24 weeks of gestation in 76 healthy pregnant women and 38 cases of PE/IUGR, of which 19 were defined as early onset (< 32 weeks). RESULTS: For a specificity of 95%, the sensitivities of uterine artery mean PI, PlGF and sFlt1 for early-onset PE/IUGR were 47.4%, 84.4% and 36.8%, respectively. When combining uterine artery Doppler with PlGF, the sensitivity for identifying early-onset PE/IUGR was 89.5% with a specificity of 95%. Conversely, the sensitivity for late-onset PE/IUGR was below 11% for all parameters analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: Angiogenic factors and uterine artery Doppler evaluation may be useful second-trimester screening tests for early-onset, but not late-onset, PE/IUGR.
18059043	Analysis of phenoxyacetic acid herbicides as biomarkers in human urine using liquid chromatography/triple quadrupole mass spectrometry.	Phenoxyacetic acids are widely used herbicides. The toxicity of phenoxyacetic acids is debated, but high-level exposure has been shown to be hepatotoxic as well as nephrotoxic in animal studies. An inter-species difference in toxic effects has been found, with dogs particularly susceptible. In this study a method using liquid chromatography/triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) is described for the analysis of 4-chloro-2-methylphenoxyacetic acid (MCPA), and its metabolite 4-chloro-2-hydroxymethylphenoxyacetic acid (HMCPA), 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), and 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) in human urine. The urine samples were treated by acid hydrolysis to degrade possible conjugations. The sample preparation was performed using solid-phase extraction. Analysis was carried out using selected reaction monitoring (SRM) in the negative ion mode. Quantification of the phenoxyacetic acids was performed using [(2)H(3)]-labeled MCPA and 2,4-D as internal standards. The method was linear in the range 0.05-310 ng/mL urine and has a within-run precision of 2-5%. The between-run precision in lower concentration ranges was between 6-15% and between 2-8% in higher concentration ranges. The limit of detection was determined to 0.05 ng/mL. The metabolites in urine were found to be stable during storage at -20 degrees C. To validate the phenoxyacetic acids as biomarkers of exposure, the method was applied in a human experimental oral exposure to MCPA, 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T. Two healthy volunteers received 200 microg of each phenoxyacetic acid in a single oral dose followed by urine sampling for 72 h post-exposure. After exposure, between 90 and 101% of the dose was recovered in the urine. In the female subject, 23%, and in the male subject 17%, of MCPA was excreted as HMCPA.
18059055	Relationships between structure, retention and biological activity of some Schiff base ligands and their complexes.	The lipophilicity of a series of Schiff base ligands and their complexes with nickel(II) and copper(II) has been determined by reversed-phase thin-layer chromatography using binary dioxane-water mobile phase. Chelate ligands were prepared by condensation of diamine and the corresponding beta-diketone. Copper(II) and nickel(II) complexes with chelate ligands containing ethane-1,2-diamine or propane-1,2-diamine as the amine part and pentane-2,4-dione and/or 1-phenylbutane-1,3-dione, pentane-2,4-dione and/or 1,1,1-trifluoropentane-2,4-dione, or 1,1,1-trifluoropentane-2,4-dione and/or 1-phenylbutane-1,3-dione as the beta-diketone part were synthesized. Some of investigated compounds were screened for their in vitro antifungal activity against Sacharomyces cerevisiae and antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli. Chromatographically obtained lipophilicity parameters were correlated both with calculated n-octanol-water partition coefficient C log P and antimicrobial activities. Satisfactory correlations were obtained. Chromatographic data proved to be reliable parameters for describing the lipophilic properties of the investigated compounds. Additionally, the principal components analysis was performed on the data chromatographically obtained. This statistical method was useful for distinguishing compounds and objective comparison of their lipophilicity parameters.
18059071	Prenatal testing for uniparental disomy: indications and clinical relevance.	This review aims to provide a rational and ethical basis for prenatal testing for uniparental disomy (UPD) in cases with abnormal ultrasound findings or numeric and/or structural chromosomal aberrations in chorionic villous or amniotic fluid samples. The clinical phenotypes of the genomic imprinting-associated paternal UPD 6 (transient neonatal diabetes mellitus), maternal UPD 7 (Silver-Russell syndrome), paternal UPD 11p (Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome), maternal UPD 14 (precocious puberty, short stature and highly variable developmental delay), paternal UPD 14 (polyhydramnios and a bell-shaped thorax), maternal UPD 15 (Prader-Willi syndrome), paternal UPD 15 (Angelman syndrome), maternal UPD 16 and UPD 20, as well as the diagnostic options, are summarized. In addition, the clinical impact of UPD testing and its relevance in various prenatal diagnostic situations are discussed. As a general rule, prenatal UPD testing, following genetic counseling, is justified if paternal UPD 14, maternal UPD 15 or paternal UPD 15 are suspected. In contrast, considering the mild phenotypes of paternal UPD 6 and maternal UPD 7, prenatal UPD testing is questionable. Because of the highly variable phenotype for paternal UPD 11p, maternal UPD 14 and maternal UPD 16, prenatal testing should be discussed critically on an individual basis. For all other chromosomes, prenatal UPD testing is purely academic and should therefore not be performed on a routine basis, particularly because a positive result might confuse the parents more than it actually helps them.
18059098	Prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in the United Arab Emirates.	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility pattern of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae among patients in the United Arab Emirates. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 130 Enterobacteriaceae comprising of Escherichia coli (n = 83), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 45) and Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 2) was studied. Of these 130 isolates, 64 were from urine. ESBL screening was by disc diffusion and confirmatory tests for ESBL phenotype were conducted using BD Phoenix ESBL System and cephalosporin/clavulanate combination discs. Susceptibility to a panel of antibiotics was evaluated. RESULTS: Of the 130 isolates, 53 (41%) were identified as having ESBL phenotype; of these, 32 (60%) were E. coli, 20 (36%) K. pneumoniae and 2 (4%) K. oxytoca. ESBL phenotype was seen in 100% of endotracheal tubes isolates, 20 (31%) from urine, 7 (58%) from blood and 4 (80%) from catheter tips. Amikacin susceptibility was 100%. Over 90% of ESBL isolates showed resistance to aztreonam and cephalosporins. All Klebsiella isolates were carbapenem sensitive. One ESBL isolate showed intermediate resistance to imipenem and meropenem (both MIC 8 microg/ml), cefotetan (MIC 32 microg/ml) and piperacillin/tazobactam (MIC 32 microg/ml). MIC for the carbapenems was lower in non-ESBL isolates (0.034 microg/ml) than ESBL isolates (0.071 microg/ml). Resistance to gentamicin, ciprofloxacin and piperacillin/tazobactam was higher in ESBL than non-ESBL isolates (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: A high prevalence of ESBL-producing bacteria exists among in-patients in the United Arab Emirates. Amikacin and carbapenems remain the most effective drugs, but the presence of carbapenem-resistant ESBL-producing E. coli and occurrence of multidrug resistance are of concern. Continued surveillance and judicious antibiotic usage are recommended.
18059271	CD19 is essential for B cell activation by promoting B cell receptor-antigen microcluster formation in response to membrane-bound ligand.	Here we describe the spatiotemporal architecture, at high molecular resolution, of receptors and signaling molecules during the early events of mouse B cell activation. In response to membrane-bound ligand stimulation, antigen aggregation occurs in B cell antigen receptor (BCR) microclusters containing immunoglobulin (Ig) M and IgD that recruit the kinase Syk and transiently associate with the coreceptor CD19. Unexpectedly, CD19-deficient B cells were significantly defective in initiation of BCR-dependent signaling, accumulation of downstream effectors and cell spreading, defects that culminated in reduced microcluster formation. Hence, we have defined the dynamics of assembly of the main constituents of the BCR 'signalosome' and revealed an essential role for CD19, independent of the costimulatory molecule CD21, in amplifying early B cell activation events in response to membrane-bound ligand stimulation.
18059338	p38 MAPK plays an essential role in apoptosis induced by photoactivation of a novel ethylene glycol porphyrin derivative.	In this study, we provide evidence that photostimulation of various cancer cells preloaded with a new photosensitizing compound, tetrakis-meso-(4-ethyleneglycol-2,3,5,6-tetrafluorophenyl) porphyrin (PORF-TEG), results in rapid activation of the cell death machinery. PORF-TEG, although primarily localized in lysosomes, induces mitochondria-driven apoptosis. The induction of apoptosis is accompanied by immediate and sustained activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and transient activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Conversely, the inhibition of p38 by PD 169316 or SB202190 and by the p38alpha dominant-negative mutant as well as the deletion of the p38alpha gene (MEFs-KO) protected cells from apoptosis, whereas inhibition of JNK did not. Activation of the p38 signaling pathway occurs upstream of caspase activation. In addition, preincubation of cells with scavengers of reactive oxygen species attenuated p38 and caspase activation and increased cell survival, thus connecting reactive oxygen species formation with the activation of the p38 pathway. Later events included degradation of Bcl-2, activation of tBid, and cleavage of Bad and Mcl-1. The data suggest a key role for p38 MAPK in PORF-TEG-photoinduced apoptosis.
18059367	Is evolvability evolvable?	In recent years, biologists have increasingly been asking whether the ability to evolve--the evolvability--of biological systems, itself evolves, and whether this phenomenon is the result of natural selection or a by-product of other evolutionary processes. The concept of evolvability, and the increasing theoretical and empirical literature that refers to it, may constitute one of several pillars on which an extended evolutionary synthesis will take shape during the next few years, although much work remains to be done on how evolvability comes about.
18060041	Adoptive transfer of effector CD8+ T cells derived from central memory cells establishes persistent T cell memory in primates.	The adoptive transfer of antigen-specific T cells that have been expanded ex vivo is being actively pursued to treat infections and malignancy in humans. The T cell populations that are available for adoptive immunotherapy include both effector memory and central memory cells, and these differ in phenotype, function, and homing. The efficacy of adoptive immunotherapy requires that transferred T cells persist in vivo, but identifying T cells that can reproducibly survive in vivo after they have been numerically expanded by in vitro culture has proven difficult. Here we show that in macaques, antigen-specific CD8(+) T cell clones derived from central memory T cells, but not effector memory T cells, persisted long-term in vivo, reacquired phenotypic and functional properties of memory T cells, and occupied memory T cell niches. These results demonstrate that clonally derived CD8+ T cells isolated from central memory T cells are distinct from those derived from effector memory T cells and retain an intrinsic capacity that enables them to survive after adoptive transfer and revert to the memory cell pool. These results could have significant implications for the selection of T cells to expand or to engineer for adoptive immunotherapy of human infections or malignancy.
18060047	Wnt5a-treated midbrain neural stem cells improve dopamine cell replacement therapy in parkinsonian mice.	Dopamine (DA) cell replacement therapy in Parkinson disease (PD) can be achieved using human fetal mesencephalic tissue; however, limited tissue availability has hindered further developments. Embryonic stem cells provide a promising alternative, but poor survival and risk of teratoma formation have prevented their clinical application. We present here a method for generating large numbers of DA neurons based on expanding and differentiating ventral midbrain (VM) neural stem cells/progenitors in the presence of key signals necessary for VM DA neuron development. Mouse VM neurospheres (VMNs) expanded with FGF2, differentiated with sonic hedgehog and FGF8, and transfected with Wnt5a (VMN-Wnt5a) generated 10-fold more DA neurons than did conventional FGF2-treated VMNs. VMN-Wnt5a cells exhibited the transcriptional and biochemical profiles and intrinsic electrophysiological properties of midbrain DA cells. Transplantation of these cells into parkinsonian mice resulted in significant cellular and functional recovery. Importantly, no tumors were detected and only a few transplanted grafts contained sporadic nestin-expressing progenitors. Our findings show that Wnt5a improves the differentiation and functional integration of stem cell-derived DA neurons in vivo and define Wnt5a-treated neural stem cells as an efficient and safe source of DA neurons for cell replacement therapy in PD.
18060393	Stable isotope dilution assays in mycotoxin analysis.	The principle and applications of stable isotope dilution assays (SIDAs) in mycotoxin analysis are critically reviewed. The general section includes historical aspects of SIDAs, the prerequisites and limitations of the use of stable isotopically labelled internal standards, and possible calibration procedures. In the application section actual SIDAs for the analysis of trichothecenes, zearalenone, fumonisins, patulin, and ochratoxin A are presented. The syntheses and availability of labelled mycotoxins for use as internal standards is reviewed and specific advances in food analysis and toxicology are demonstrated. The review indicates that LC-MS applications, in particular, require the use of stable isotopically labelled standards to compensate for losses during clean-up and for discrimination due to ion suppression. As the commercial availability of these compounds continues to increase, SIDAs can be expected to find expanding use in mycotoxin analysis.
18060395	fMRI reliability in subjects with stroke.	Functional MRI (fMRI) has become one of the most commonly used neuroimaging tools to assess the cortical effects associated with rehabilitation, learning, or disease recovery in subjects with stroke. Despite this, there has been no systematic study of the reliability of the fMR signal in this population. The purpose of this study was to examine the within- and between-session reliability of fMRI in cortical and cerebellar structures in subjects with stroke during a complex, continuous visual motor task performed with the less affected hand. Nine subjects with stroke underwent four testing trials during two sessions separated by three weeks. Subjects performed a drawing task using an MRI compatible joystick while in the MRI. Methods of analysis evaluated included: percent signal intensity change, active voxel count and a voxel by voxel stat value analysis within and between testing sessions. Reliability was determined with Interclass correlation coefficients (ICC) in the following regions of interest: primary motor (M1), primary sensory (S1), premotor cortex (PMC), medial cerebellum (MCB), and lateral cerebellum (LCB). Results indicate that intensity change has superior reliability to the other methods of analysis (Average ICC across brain regions and trials: intensity change: 0.73, voxel count: 0.58, voxel by voxel: 0.67) and that generally with any analysis method, within-session reliability was higher than between-session, as indicated by higher ICC values across brain regions. Overall, when comparing between-session results, moderate to good reliability was obtained with intensity change (ICC: M1: 0.52, S1: 0.80, SMA: 0.78, PMC: 0.94, MCB: 0.86, and LCB: 0.59). These results show good reliability in subjects with stroke when performing a continuous motor task. These findings give confidence for interpreting fMRI test/retest research in subjects with stroke.
18060420	Fermentable metabolite of Zymomonas mobilis controls collagen reduction in photoaging skin by improving TGF-beta/Smad signaling suppression.	Solar ultraviolet (UV) irradiation causes damages on human skin and premature skin aging (photoaging). UV-induced reduction of type I collagen in dermis is widely considered primarily induction of wrinkled appearance of photoaging skin. Type I procollagen synthesis is reduced under UV irradiation by blocking transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)/Smad signaling; more specifically, it is down-regulation of TGF-beta type II receptor (T beta RII). Therefore, preventing UV-induced loss of T beta RII results decreased type I collagen reduction in photoaging skin. Zymomonas mobilis is an alcohol fermentable, gram-negative facultative anaerobic bacterium whose effect on skin tissue is scarcely studied. We investigated the protective effects of fermentable metabolite of Z. mobilis (FM of Z. mobilis) against reduction of type I procollagen synthesis of UV-induced down-regulation of T beta RII in human dermal fibroblasts FM of Z. mobilis was obtained from lyophilization of bacterium culture supernatant. The levels of T beta RII and type I procollagen mRNA in human dermal fibroblasts were measured by quantitative real-time RT-PCR, and T beta RII protein levels were assayed by western blotting. T beta RII, type I procollagen, and type I collagen proteins in human dermal fibroblasts or hairless mouse skin were detected by immunostaining. FM of Z. mobilis inhibited down regulation of T beta RII mRNA, and protein levels in UVB irradiated human dermal fibroblasts consequently recover reduced type I procollagen synthesis. These results indicate UVB irradiation inhibits type I procollagen synthesis by suppression of TGF-beta/Smad signaling pathway, and FM of Z. mobilis has inhibitory effect on UVB-induced reduction of type I procollagen synthesis. While short period UVB irradiation decreased both T beta RII and type I procollagen protein levels in hairless mouse skin, topical application of FM of Z. mobilis prevented this decrease. Wrinkle formation in hairless mouse skin surface was accelerated by continuous 5 month UVB irradiation along with a reduction of type I collagen in the dermis, but this change was prevented by topical application of FM of Z. mobilis. From this experimental data, it is suggested that FM of Z. mobilis is effective for suppression of wrinkle formation in photoaging skin by inhibition of type I procollagen synthesis reduction.
18060440	Serpins in plants and green algae.	Control of proteolysis is important for plant growth, development, responses to stress, and defence against insects and pathogens. Members of the serpin protein family are likely to play a critical role in this control through irreversible inhibition of endogenous and exogenous target proteinases. Serpins have been found in diverse species of the plant kingdom and represent a distinct clade among serpins in multicellular organisms. Serpins are also found in green algae, but the evolutionary relationship between these serpins and those of plants remains unknown. Plant serpins are potent inhibitors of mammalian serine proteinases of the chymotrypsin family in vitro but, intriguingly, plants and green algae lack endogenous members of this proteinase family, the most common targets for animal serpins. An Arabidopsis serpin with a conserved reactive centre is now known to be capable of inhibiting an endogenous cysteine proteinase. Here, knowledge of plant serpins in terms of sequence diversity, inhibitory specificity, gene expression and function is reviewed. This was advanced through a phylogenetic analysis of amino acid sequences of expressed plant serpins, delineation of plant serpin gene structures and prediction of inhibitory specificities based on identification of reactive centres. The review is intended to encourage elucidation of plant serpin functions.
18060449	Sugar beet-associated bacterial and fungal communities show a high indigenous antagonistic potential against plant pathogens.	The aim of this study was to analyze microbial communities in/on sugar beet with special focus on antagonists toward plant pathogens. For this purpose, the composition of microorganisms isolated from the rhizosphere, phyllosphere, endorhiza, and endosphere of field-grown sugar beet plants was analyzed by a multiphasic approach at three different plant development stages at six locations in Europe. The analysis of microbial communities by Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism (SSCP) of 16S/18S rRNA clearly revealed the existence of discrete microenvironment- and site-specific patterns. A total of 1952 bacterial and 1344 fungal isolates screened by dual testing for antagonism toward the pathogens Aphanomyces cochlioides, Phoma betae, Pythium ultimum, and Rhizoctonia solani resulted in 885 bacterial (=45%) and 437 fungal (=33%) antagonists. In general, the indigenous antagonistic potential was very high and influenced by (a) the location, (b) the plant developmental stage, and (3) the microenvironment. Furthermore, we showed for the first time that the antagonistic potential was highly specific for each target pathogen. The majority of antagonistic microorganisms suppressed only one pathogen (bacteria: 664 = 75%; fungi: 256 = 59%), whereas the minority showed a broad host range (bacteria: 4 = 0.5%; fungi: 7 = 1.6%). The bacterial communities harbored the highest antagonistic potential against P. ultimum, whereas the fungal communities contained more antagonists against A. cochlioides and R. solani. In contrast to their high proportion, only a low diversity of antagonists at genotypic and species level was found. Novel antagonistic species, e.g., Subtercola pratensis or Microbacterium testaceum were found in the internal part of the sugar beet body.
18060506	An eleven amino acid residue deletion expands the substrate specificity of acetyl xylan esterase II (AXE II) from Penicillium purpurogenum.	The soft-rot fungus Penicillium purpurogenum secretes to the culture medium a variety of enzymes related to xylan biodegradation, among them three acetyl xylan esterases (AXE I, II and III). AXE II has 207 amino acids; it belongs to family 5 of the carbohydrate esterases and its structure has been determined by X-ray crystallography at 0.9 A resolution (PDB 1G66). The enzyme possesses the alpha/beta hydrolase fold and the catalytic triad typical of serine esterases (Ser90, His187 and Asp175). AXE II can hydrolyze esters of a large variety of alcohols, but it is restricted to short chain fatty acids. An analysis of its three-dimensional structure shows that a loop that covers the active site may be responsible for this strict specificity. Cutinase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes esters of long chain fatty acids and shows a structure similar to AXE II, lacks this loop. In order to generate an AXE II with this broader specificity, the preparation of a mutant lacking residues involving this loop (Gly104 to Ala114) was proposed. A set of molecular simulation experiments based on a comparative model of the mutant enzyme predicted a stable structure. Using site-directed mutagenesis, the loop's residues have been eliminated from the AXE II cDNA. The mutant protein has been expressed in Aspergillus nidulans A722 and Pichia pastoris, and it is active towards a range of fatty acid esters of up to at least 14 carbons. The availability of an esterase with broader specificity may have biotechnological applications for the synthesis of sugar esters.
18060556	Assembly, organization, and function of the COPII coat.	A full mechanistic understanding of how secretory cargo proteins are exported from the endoplasmic reticulum for passage through the early secretory pathway is essential for us to comprehend how cells are organized, maintain compartment identity, as well as how they selectively secrete proteins and other macromolecules to the extracellular space. This process depends on the function of a multi-subunit complex, the COPII coat. Here we describe progress towards a full mechanistic understanding of COPII coat function, including the latest findings in this area. Much of our understanding of how COPII functions and is regulated comes from studies of yeast genetics, biochemical reconstitution and single cell microscopy. New developments arising from clinical cases and model organism biology and genetics enable us to gain far greater insight in to the role of membrane traffic in the context of a whole organism as well as during embryogenesis and development. A significant outcome of such a full understanding is to reveal how the machinery and processes of membrane trafficking through the early secretory pathway fail in disease states.
18060744	Interleukin-1beta and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) in dermal fibroblasts mediate UVA-induced matrix metalloproteinase-1 expression.	BACKGROUND: Exposure to solar UV radiation is the main environmental factor that causes premature aging of the skin. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-1 is a member of the MMP family and degrades types I and III collagens, which are the major structural components of the dermis. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the involvement IL-1beta and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) in MMP-1 expression under ultraviolet A (UVA) irradiation. METHODS: IL-1beta and MIF in MMP-1 expression in cultured human dermal fibroblasts and the UVA effects on MMPs production using IL-1alpha/beta-deficient mice were analyzed. Furthermore, fibroblasts derived from MIF-deficient mice were used to analyze the effect of IL-1beta-induced MMPs production. RESULTS: IL-1beta-enhanced MIF expression and induced MMP-1 in cultured human dermal fibroblasts. IL-1beta-induced MMP-1 expression is inhibited by neutralizing anti-MIF antibody. Dermal fibroblasts of IL-1alpha/beta-deficient mice produced significantly decreased levels of MMPs compared to wild-type mice after UVA irradiation. Furthermore, fibroblasts of MIF-deficient mice were much less sensitive to IL-1beta-induced MMPs production. On the contrary, IL-1beta produced significantly decreased levels of MMPs in MIF-deficient mice fibroblasts. The up-regulation of MMP-1 mRNA by IL-1beta stimulation was found to be inhibited by a p38 inhibitor and a JNK inhibitor. In contrast, the MEK inhibitor and inhibitor were found to have little effect on expression of MMP-1 mRNA. CONCLUSIONS: IL-1beta is involved in the up-regulation of UVA-induced MMP-1 in dermal fibroblasts, and IL-1beta and MIF cytokine network induce MMP-1 and contribute to the loss of interstitial collagen in skin photoaging.
18060814	Identification and analysis of differentially expressed Heterobasidion parviporum genes during natural colonization of Norway spruce stems.	To identify differentially expressed genes of the white-rot fungus Heterobasidion parviporum, two cDNA libraries were constructed using suppressive subtraction hybridization (SSH) technique with RNA extracted from an advanced stage of decay area and from colonization front next to the reaction zone of the stem of a mature Norway spruce naturally colonized by the fungus. Besides several cytochrome P450s and hypothetical proteins with unknown function, the SSH libraries constructed contained, among others, genes involved in basic cellular processes, and lignin and cellulose degradation. To examine the role of selected candidate genes for each functional group, three trees, each colonized by a different genotype of the pathogen and showing a variable degree of wood decay, were used for real-time RT-PCR profiling of candidate genes. In the decay transition areas the study revealed activity centers that showed remarkable similarity in the transcript profiles of the monitored genes.
18060870	Transforming growth factor-beta enables NFATc1 expression during osteoclastogenesis.	Osteoclastogenesis is dependent on distinct stimuli that prime and activate osteoclast differentiation. One cytokine needed to prime monocytes for osteoclastogenesis is TGF-beta, which enables and augments RANKL and TNF-alpha-induced osteoclast differentiation. However, the precise time-period during which this occurs and the molecular mechanism mediating this action are unknown. We report here TGF-beta prime monocytes for osteoclast formation within 24h by regulating expression of NFATc1, a key osteoclastic transcription factor. TGF-beta directly induces cytoplasmic NFATc1 expression within 24h, but is unable to stimulate NFATc1 nuclear translocation. Furthermore, RANKL-induced NFATc1 expression is dependent on the presence of TGF-beta during the early stages of osteoclastogenesis. Similarly, TNF-alpha activates osteoclastogenesis by stimulating translocation of TGF-beta-induced NFATc1. In light of these findings, it is apparent that osteoclast formation is dependent on coordinated interactions between TGF-beta and RANKL/TNF-alpha that regulate the expression and intracellular distribution of NFATc1 during early stages of osteoclast differentiation.
18061228	Focusing the immune response on the V3 loop, a neutralizing epitope of the HIV-1 gp120 envelope.	Rabbits were immunized with a novel regimen designed to focus the immune response on a single neutralizing epitope of HIV-1 gp120 and thereby preferentially induce neutralizing antibodies (Abs). Animals were primed with gp120 DNA from a clade A Env bearing the GPGR V3 motif and/or a clade C Env bearing the GPGQ V3 motif, and boosted with one or more fusion proteins containing V3 sequences from clades A, B and/or C. Immune sera neutralized three of four Tier 1 primary isolates, including strains heterologous to the immunizing strains, and potent cross-clade-neutralizing activity was demonstrated against V3 chimeric pseudoviruses carrying in a Tier 1 Env, the consensus V3 sequences from clades A1, AG, B, AE, or F. The broadest and most potent neutralizing responses were elicited with the clade C gp120 DNA and a combination of V3-fusion proteins from clades A, B and C. Neutralizing activity was primarily due to V3-specific Abs. The results demonstrate that the immune response can be focused on a neutralizing epitope and show that the anti-V3 Abs induced recognize a diverse set of V3 loops.
18061331	D-Serine exposure resulted in gene expression changes indicative of activation of fibrogenic pathways and down-regulation of energy metabolism and oxidative stress response.	Renal toxicity can commonly occur after exposure to xenobiotics, pharmaceutical agents or environmental pollutants. Changes in the gene expression in kidney parenchymal cells that precede and/or accompany renal injury may be hallmark critical events in the onset of pathologic changes of renal functions. Over the last several years, transcriptomic analysis has evolved to enable simultaneous analysis of the expression profiles of tens of thousands of genes in response to various endogenous and exogenous stimuli. In this study, we investigated gene expression changes in the kidney after acute exposure to a nephrotoxin, D-serine, which targets the proximal tubule of the kidney. Male F-344 rats injected intraperitoneally with a single dose of D-serine (5, 20, 50, 200 or 500 mg/kg), and gene expression profiles in the kidney were determined using the Affymetrix RAE230A gene arrays at 96 h post-dosing. D-serine treatment resulted in the up- and down-regulation of 1158 and 749 genes, respectively, over the entire dose range based on the intersection of the results of t-test, p<0.01 over two consecutive doses, and ANOVA with Bonferonni correction for multiple testing. Interestingly, both the up-and down-regulated genes show a unified dose response pattern as revealed in the self-organized map clustering analysis using the expression profiles of the 1907 differentially expressed genes as input data. There appears to be minimal changes in the expression level of these genes in the dose range of 5-50 mg/kg, while the most prominent changes were observed at the highest doses tested, i.e. 200 and 500 mg/kg. Pathway analysis of the differentially expressed genes showed perturbation of a large number of biological processes/pathways after d-serine exposure. Among the up-regulated pathways are actin cytoskeleton biogenesis and organization, apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, chromatin assembly, excision repair of damaged DNA, DNA replication and packaging, protein biosynthesis, metabolism and transport, inflammatory response, proteasome-mediated degradation of oxidatively damaged cytosolic proteins, Ras protein signal transduction, TGF-beta signaling pathway and mRNA transcription, processing, splicing and transport. On the other hand, major metabolic pathways, which include carbohydrate metabolism, TCA cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, ATP synthesis coupled electron transport, amino acid metabolism and transport, lipid metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, and vitamin metabolism, and oxidative stress response including induction of antioxidant genes and glutathione metabolism are down-regulated. As tubular epithelia have strong energy demand for normal functions, down-regulation of energy metabolism after D-serine treatment may be related to the mechanism of its nephrotoxicity. In addition, hydrogen peroxide, a reactive oxygen species, is produced as a byproduct of the metabolism of D-serine by D-amino acid oxidase in the peroxisomes of the tubular epithelia. Down-regulation of pathways for antioxidant genes induction and glutathione metabolism will likely exacerbate the cytotoxicity of this reactive oxygen species. The observation that the genes involved in apoptosis, DNA repair, proteasome pathway for the degradation of oxidatively damaged cytosolic proteins were up-regulated lends some supports to this premise. Up-regulation of pathways of cell proliferation cycle, DNA replication and gene expression process, including mRNA transcription, processing, splicing, transport, translation initiation, and protein transport along with protein complex assembly, suggests ongoing tissue repair and regeneration. Consistent with the fibrogenic function of the TGF-beta signaling pathway in various experimental renal diseases, genes encoding major extracellular matrix components such as collagens, laminins, fibronectin 1 and tenascins are also strongly up-regulated. Taken together, the results of this study provide important insights into the molecular mechanism of D-serine nephrotoxicity, as well as the activation of specific cellular pathways in response to this toxic insult.
18061589	Techniques for clustering gene expression data.	Many clustering techniques have been proposed for the analysis of gene expression data obtained from microarray experiments. However, choice of suitable method(s) for a given experimental dataset is not straightforward. Common approaches do not translate well and fail to take account of the data profile. This review paper surveys state of the art applications which recognise these limitations and addresses them. As such, it provides a framework for the evaluation of clustering in gene expression analyses. The nature of microarray data is discussed briefly. Selected examples are presented for clustering methods considered.
18061671	Effects of supplemental ultraviolet-B and cadmium on growth, antioxidants and yield of Pisum sativum L.	The impact of supplemental UV-B irradiation (sUV-B) and cadmium (Cd, 68 micromol kg(-1) soil) singly and in combination was studied on growth, pigments, enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants, lipid peroxidation (LPO), uptake and translocation of Cd and yield of pea plants under field condition. Compared to the control, both the stresses individually and in combination led to in reductions in growth, photosynthetic pigments, ascorbic acid, catalase (CAT) activity and yield, whereas a reverse trend was observed for flavonoids, thiols and proline contents, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) activities, and LPO. The uptake and translocation of Cd increased in different plant parts with duration of its treatment and also when applied with sUV-B. Combined treatment of sUV-B and Cd inhibited the growth and various metabolic processes antagonistically except the CAT activity which showed additive response. Further, CAT activity may be used as a bioindicator parameter to evaluate the individual and interactive effects of both the stresses.
18061977	Trends in drug prescribing for osteoporosis after hip fracture, 1995-2004.	OBJECTIVE: To examine trends in osteoporosis drug prescribing after hip fracture from 1995 to 2004. METHODS: We conducted a population-based study of enrollees in the Pennsylvania Pharmaceutical Assistance Contract for the Elderly. Hip fractures were identified using Medicare hospital claims between January 1, 1995, and June 30, 2004. Osteoporosis treatment comprised oral bisphosphonates, calcitonin, hormone therapy, raloxifene, and/or teriparatide. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to estimate the probability of treatment within 6 months of fracture, censoring patients on their date of death or 6 months postfracture. RESULTS: Treatment within 6 months after hip fracture improved from 7% in 1995 to 31% in 2002, and then remained stable through 2004. Similar patterns were observed among new users, with treatment increasing from 4% in 1995 to 17% in 2002, with no subsequent increase through 2004. Bisphosphonates led other treatments in the frequency of prescribing, except during 1997-99, when calcitonin was the most common. Among women, hormone therapy prescribing decreased from 22% of those treated in 1995 to 4% in 2004, and raloxifene prescribing remained relatively constant (4%-10%) since its introduction (p for trend = 0.15). Of patients treated before and after hip fracture, 18% changed therapy postfracture. Significantly more patients changed therapy following fracture if a different physician prescribed treatment (26%) compared to those treated by the same physician pre- and postfracture (13%; p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Prescribing practices changed substantially over the 10 years of study. The proportion of hip fracture patients treated with osteoporosis drugs has increased, but remains low, with fewer than one-third receiving pharmacotherapy.
18062665	Whole genome searching with shotgun proteomic data: applications for genome annotation.	High-throughput genome sequencing continues to accelerate the rate at which complete genomes are available for biological research. Many of these new genome sequences have little or no genome annotation currently available and hence rely upon computational predictions of protein coding genes. Evidence of translation from proteomic techniques could facilitate experimental validation of protein coding genes, but the techniques for whole genome searching with MS/MS data have not been adequately developed to date. Here we describe GENQUEST, a novel method using peptide isoelectric focusing and accurate mass to greatly reduce the peptide search space, making fast, accurate, and sensitive whole human genome searching possible on common desktop computers. In an initial experiment, almost all exonic peptides identified in a protein database search were identified when searching genomic sequence. Many peptides identified exclusively in the genome searches were incorrectly identified or could not be experimentally validated, highlighting the importance of orthogonal validation. Experimentally validated peptides exclusive to the genomic searches can be used to reannotate protein coding genes. GENQUEST represents an experimental tool that can be used by the proteomics community at large for validating computational approaches to genome annotation.
18062844	Epistemological beliefs in child care: implications for vocational education.	BACKGROUND: The quality of child care is of social and economic significance worldwide. The beliefs that child care workers hold about knowing and knowledge (epistemological beliefs) influence the quality of their professional work. However, attention to epistemological beliefs is rarely a focus in vocational education programmes. AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the nature of child care students' epistemological beliefs. SAMPLE(S): All first- and second-year students completing a Diploma of Children's Services at three separate training institutes in a large metropolitan area in Australia were invited to participate in the study. There were 46 first- and 31 second-year students (77 in total, 71 females). METHOD: This study used semi-structured interviews based on a child care scenario to enable students to articulate their epistemological beliefs. A descriptive-interpretative approach in which interviews were analysed for patterns of meaning was used in the content analysis. The categories, based on the work of Kuhn and Weinstock (2002), included objectivism, subjectivism, and evaluativism. While this proved to be a useful framework, the authors remained open to new categories emerging. This constituted the interpretive component of the analysis. Therefore, the data were analysed using both data-driven and theory-led approaches to analysis, which still made it possible to take account of many viewpoints before arriving at the categories of beliefs. The categories were audited by a second researcher to establish trustworthiness and credibility. RESULTS: The findings of this study revealed a range of epistemological beliefs; however, a new way of thinking about evaluativistic beliefs called 'basic evaluativism' emerged. This view of knowledge relates to the construction of evidence-based practice rather than knowledge as is typically the case in evaluativistic beliefs. CONCLUSIONS: Implications for the need to address epistemological beliefs in vocational education programmes for child care workers are discussed.
18062917	Twist is a transcriptional repressor of E-cadherin gene expression in breast cancer.	Twist is a basic helix loop helix protein that plays a role both in human development and in cancer biogenesis. While characterizing the effects of Twist on breast epithelial cell transformation, we identified E-cadherin as a target gene that is down-regulated by Twist. In this study, we demonstrate that Twist can transcriptionally repress E-cadherin in breast cancer cells. Using transient promoter assays, we show that Twist can down-regulate E-cadherin promoter activity by up to two folds. This is further supported by immunoblot analyses which indicates that over-expression of Twist decreases E-cadherin protein levels in breast cancer cell lines. Subsequently, chromatin immunoprecipitation performed on MCF-7/Twist and Hs578 T (high level of endogenous Twist expression) confirmed Twist binding to the E-cadherin promoter. Finally, the functional relevance of this regulation was verified by quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry on a cohort of breast cancer samples.
18062990	Structures of dimeric nonstandard nucleotide triphosphate pyrophosphatase from Pyrococcus horikoshii OT3: functional significance of interprotomer conformational changes.	Nonstandard nucleotide triphosphate pyrophosphatase (NTPase) can efficiently hydrolyze nonstandard purine nucleotides in the presence of divalent cations. The crystal structures of the NTPase from Pyrococcus horikoshii OT3 (PhNTPase) have been determined in two unliganded forms and in three liganded forms with inosine 5'-monophosphate (IMP), ITP and Mn(2+), which visualize the recognition of these ligands unambiguously. The overall structure of PhNTPase is similar to that of previously reported crystal structures of the NTPase from Methanococcus jannaschii and the human ITPase. They share a similar protomer folding with two domains and a similar homodimeric quaternary structure. The dimeric interface of NTPase is well conserved, and the dimeric state might be important to constitute the active site of this enzyme. A conformational analysis of the five snapshots of PhNTPase structures using the multiple superposition method reveals that IMP, ITP and Mn(2+) bind to the active site without inducing large local conformational changes, indicating that a combination of interdomain and interprotomer rigid-body shifts mainly describes the conformational change of PhNTPase. The interdomain and interprotomer conformations of the ITP liganded form are essentially the same as those observed in the unliganded form 1, indicating that ITP binding to PhNTPase in solution may follow the selection mode in which ITP binds to the subunit that happens to be in the conformation observed in the unliganded form 1. In contrast to the human ITPase inducing a large domain closure upon ITP binding, the interdomain active site cleft is generally closed in PhNTPase and only the IMP binding form shows a remarkable domain opening by 14 degrees only in the B subunit. The interprotomer rigid-body rotation of PhNTPase has a tendency to keep the dimeric 2-fold symmetry, which is also true in human ITPase, thereby suggesting its relevance to the positive cooperativity of the dimeric NTPases. The exception of this rule is observed in the IMP liganded form in which the dimeric 2-fold symmetry is broken by a 3 degrees interprotomer rotation in an unusual direction. A combination of the exceptional interdomain and interprotomer relocations is most likely the reason for the observed asymmetric IMP binding that might be necessary for PhNTPase to release the reaction product IMP.
18062991	The crystal structures of ornithine carbamoyltransferase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis and its ternary complex with carbamoyl phosphate and L-norvaline reveal the enzyme's catalytic mechanism.	Mycobacterium tuberculosis ornithine carbamoyltransferase (Mtb OTC) catalyzes the sixth step in arginine biosynthesis; it produces citrulline from carbamoyl phosphate (CP) and ornithine (ORN). Here, we report the crystal structures of Mtb OTC in orthorhombic (form I) and hexagonal (form II) space groups. The molecules in form II are complexed with CP and l-norvaline (NVA); the latter is a competitive inhibitor of OTC. The asymmetric unit in form I contains a pseudo hexamer with 32 point group symmetry. The CP and NVA in form II induce a remarkable conformational change in the 80s and the 240s loops with the displacement of these loops towards the active site. The displacement of these loops is strikingly different from that seen in other OTC structures. In addition, the ligands induce a domain closure of 4.4 degrees in form II. Sequence comparison of active-site residues of Mtb OTC with several other OTCs of known structure reveals that they are virtually identical. The interactions involving the active-site residues of Mtb OTC with CP and NVA and a modeling study of ORN in the form II structure strongly rule out an earlier proposed mechanistic role of Cys264 in catalysis and suggest a possible mechanism for OTC. Our results strongly support the view that ORN with an already deprotonated N(epsilon) atom is the species that binds to the enzyme and that one of the phosphate oxygen atoms of CP is likely to be involved in accepting a proton from the doubly protonated N(epsilon) atom of ORN. We have interpreted this deprotonation as part of the collapse of the transition state of the reaction.
18063004	Mechanisms for enveloped virus budding: can some viruses do without an ESCRT?	Many enveloped viruses complete their replication cycle by forming vesicles that bud from the plasma membrane. Some viruses encode "late" (L) domain motifs that are able to hijack host proteins involved in the vacuolar protein sorting (VPS) pathway, a cellular budding process that gives rise to multivesicular bodies and that is topologically equivalent to virus budding. Although many enveloped viruses share this mechanism, examples of viruses that require additional viral factors and viruses that appear to be independent of the VPS pathway have been identified. Alternative mechanisms for virus budding could involve other topologically similar process such as cell abscission, which occurs following cytokinesis, or virus budding could proceed spontaneously as a result of lipid microdomain accumulation of viral proteins. Further examination of novel virus-host protein interactions and characterization of other enveloped viruses for which budding requirements are currently unknown will lead to a better understanding of the cellular processes involved in virus assembly and budding.
18063336	Validation study of a pulsed arterial spin labeling technique by comparison to perfusion computed tomography.	Abnormalities in cerebral blood flow (CBF) are believed to play a significant role in the development of major neonatal neuropathologies. One approach that would appear ideal for measuring CBF in this fragile age group is arterial spin labeling (ASL) since ASL techniques are noninvasive and quantitative. The purpose of this study was to assess the accuracy of a pulsed ASL method implemented on a 3-T scanner dedicated to neonatal imaging. Cerebral blood flow was measured in nine neonatal piglets, the ASL-CBF measurements were acquired at two inversion times (TI) (1,200 and 1,700 ms), and CBF was measured by perfusion computed tomography (pCT) for validation. Perfusion CT also provided images of cerebral blood volume, which were used to identify large blood vessels, and contrast arrival time, which were used to assess differences in arterial transit times between gray and white matter. Good agreement was found between gray matter CBF values from pCT (76+/-1 ml/min per 100 g) and ASL at TI=1,700 ms (73+/-1 ml/min per 100 g). At TI=1,200 ms, ASL overestimated CBF (91+/-2 ml/min per 100 g), which was attributed to substantial intravascular signal. No significant differences in white matter CBF from pCT and ASL were observed (average CBF=60+/-1 ml/min per 100 g), nor was there any difference in contrast arrival times for gray and white matter (0.95+/-0.04 and 0.99+/-0.03 s, respectively), which suggests that the arterial transit times for ASL were the same in this animal model. This study verified the accuracy of the implemented ASL technique and showed the value of using pCT to study other factors that can affect ASL-CBF measurements.
18063385	Collisionally activated dissociation and electron capture dissociation provide complementary structural information for branched permethylated oligosaccharides.	Doubly charged sodiated and permethylated linear malto-oligosaccharides ({Glc}6-{Glc}9), branched N-linked glycans (high-mannose type GlcNAc2Man5-9, and complex asialo- and disialylated-biantennary glycans) were analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry using collisionally-activated dissociation (CAD) and "hot" electron capture dissociation (ECD) available in a custom-built ESI FTICR mass spectrometer. For linear permethylated malto-oligosaccharides, both CAD and "hot" ECD produced glycosidic cleavages (B, Y, C, and Z ions), cross-ring cleavages (A- and X-type), and internal cleavages (B/Y and C/Y type) to provide sequence and linkage information. For the branched N-linked glycans, CAD and "hot" ECD provided complementary structural information. CAD generated abundant B and Y fragment ions by glycosidic cleavages, whereas "hot" ECD produced dominant C and Z ions. A-type cross-ring cleavages were present in CAD spectra. Complementary A- and X-type cross-ring fragmentation pairs were generated by "hot" ECD, and these delineated the branching patterns and linkage positions. For example, 0, 4An and 3, 5An ions defined the linkage position of the major branch as the 6-position of the central core mannose residue. The internal fragments observed in CAD were more numerous and abundant than in "hot" ECD spectra. Since the triply charged (sodiated) molecular ion of the permethylated disialylated-biantennary N-linked glycan has relatively high abundance, it was isolated and fragmented in a "hot" ECD experiment and extensive fragment ions (glycosidic and complementary pairs of cross-ring cleavages) were generated to fully confirm the sequence, branching, and linkage assignments for this glycan.
18063435	A chemical mutagenesis screen to identify modifier genes that interact with growth hormone and TGF-beta signaling pathways.	We describe a phenotype-driven mutagenesis screen in which mice carrying a targeted mutation are bred with ENU-treated males in order to provide a sensitized system for detecting dominant modifier mutations. The presence of initial mutation renders the screening system more responsive to subtle changes in modifier genes that would not be penetrant in an otherwise wild type background. We utilized two mutant mouse models: 1) mice carrying a mutation in growth hormone releasing hormone receptor (Ghrhr) (denoted 'lit' allele, Ghrhr(lit)), which results in GH deficiency; and 2) mice lacking Smad2 gene, a signal transducer for TGF-beta, an important bone growth factor. The Smad2(-/-) mice are lethal and Ghrhr(lit/lit) mice are dwarf, but both Smad2(+/-) and Ghrhr(lit/)(+) mice exhibit normal growth. We injected 6-7 weeks old C57BL/6J male mice with ENU (100 mg/kg dose) and bred them with Ghrhr(lit/)(+) and Smad2(+/-) mice. The F1 mice with Ghrhr(lit/)(+) or Smad2(+/-) genotype were screened for growth and skeletal phenotypes. An outlier was identified as >3 SD units different from wild type control (n=20-30). We screened about 100 F1 mice with Ghrhr(lit/)(+) and Smad2(+/-) genotypes and identified nine outliers. A backcross established heritability of three mutant lines in multiple generations. Among the phenotypic deviants, we have identified a mutant mouse with 30-40% reduced bone size. The magnitude of the bone size phenotype was amplified by the presence of one copy of the disrupted Ghrhr gene as determined by the 2-way ANOVA (p<0.02 for interaction). Thus, a new mouse model has been established to identify a gene that interacts with GH signaling to regulate bone size. In addition, the sensitized screen also demonstrated higher recovery of skeletal phenotypes as compared to that obtained in the classical ENU screen in wild type mice. The discovery of mutants in a selected pathway will provide a valuable tool to not only to discover novel genes involved in a particular process but will also prove useful for the elucidation of the biology of that process.
18063459	Advances in the diagnosis and therapy of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.	PNH is an uncommon acquired hemolytic anemia that often manifests with hemoglobinuria, abdominal pain, smooth muscle dystonias, fatigue, and thrombosis. The disease results from the expansion of hematopoietic stem cells harboring a mutation in a gene, PIG-A, that is required for the biosynthesis of a lipid moiety, glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI), that attaches dozens of different proteins to the cell surface. Thus, PNH cells are deficient in cell surface GPI anchored proteins; this deficiency on erythrocytes leads to intravascular hemolysis since certain GPI anchored proteins normally function as complement regulators. Free hemoglobin released from intravascular hemolysis leads to circulating nitric oxide depletion and is responsible for many of the clinical manifestations of PNH, including fatigue, erectile dysfunction, esophageal spasm, and thrombosis. Interestingly, rare PIG-A mutations can be found in virtually all healthy control subjects leading to speculation that PIG-A mutations in hematopoietic stem cells are common benign events. However, recent data reveals that most of these mutations in healthy controls are not derived from stem cells. The recently FDA approved complement inhibitor eculizumab has been shown to decrease hemolysis, decrease erythrocyte transfusion requirements, decrease the risk for thrombosis and improve quality of life for PNH patients.
18063483	High prevalence of Cryptosporidium bovis and the deer-like genotype in calves compared to mature cows in beef cow-calf operations.	Recent studies have identified the novel, host adapted Cryptosporidium bovis and the deer-like genotype in dairy cattle from farms in the United States, China, India and Europe. This novel species and genotype appear to be more prevalent in older, post-weaned dairy cattle than previously thought. However, little information is available on their prevalence in beef cow-calf operations. In the present study, we determined the prevalence of Cryptosporidium species in 98 calves (6-8 months old) and 114 cows (>2 years old) in seven beef cow-calf herds in western North Dakota. DNA was extracted from fecal samples and Cryptosporidium spp. were identified by amplification of the 18S rRNA gene followed by sequencing or RFLP analysis. All seven herds tested positive for Cryptosporidium. Overall, 43/212 (20.3%) animals were positive. Only five of these positives were from cows. C. bovis, the deer-like genotype and C. andersoni were identified in 9.4, 6.6 and 1.4% of animals sampled, respectively. C. parvum was not identified in any of the positive samples. C. bovis, the deer-like genotype and C. andersoni were detected in 6/7, 5/7 and 2/7 herds, respectively. C. bovis and the deer-like genotype were primarily detected in calves, while C. andersoni was only detected in cows. Six isolates could not be typed. These results show a relatively high prevalence of C. bovis and the deer-like genotype in 6-8-month-old beef calves compared to cows older than 2 years in the seven herds studied.

18063867	Investigation of lipopolysaccharide receptor expression on human monocytes after major orthopaedic surgery.	BACKGROUND: The innate immune system is suppressed after major orthopaedic surgery, implicating a risk of septic complications. Whole-blood ex vivo testing with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) has shown a depression of the tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) production until 12 days postoperatively. As part of the innate immune system, the Toll-like receptors TLR2 and TLR4 recognize antigens from Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, respectively. The receptors CD14 and CD11b are involved in the LPS receptor complex, whereas human lymphocyte antigen (HLA)-DR binds endotoxin peptides. It is still uncertain whether the expression of all these receptors changes after major surgery. METHODS: In 6 patients undergoing hip arthroplasty, we investigated three times the display of TLR4, TLR2, CD14, CD11b, and HLA-DR on monocytes by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and white blood cell counts during 12 days postoperatively. At the same time, the plasma levels of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, and TNF-alpha were measured. RESULTS: There was no significant change in the expression of TLR4, CD14, CD11b, HLA-DR, and TLR2. Monocyte count and cytokine analysis did not differ from the ones pre-operatively taken. CONCLUSIONS: After aseptic orthopaedic surgery, there is no change in the display of the LPS receptor complex on monocytes. Other mechanisms have to be investigated to gain insight into the decrease of the TNF-alpha production capacity postoperatively.
18064589	An evaluation of spatial thresholding techniques in fMRI analysis.	Many fMRI experiments have a common objective of identifying active voxels in a neuroimaging dataset. This is done in single subject experiments, for example, by performing individual voxel-wise tests of the null hypothesis that the observed time course is not significantly related to an assigned reference function. A voxel activation map is then constructed by applying a thresholding rule to the resulting statistics (e.g., t-statistics). Typically the task-related activation is expected to occur in clusters of voxels rather than in isolated single voxels. A variety of spatial thresholding techniques have been proposed to reflect this belief, including smoothing the raw t-statistics, cluster size inference, and spatial mixture modeling. We study two aspects of these spatial thresholding procedures applied to single subject fMRI analysis through simulation. First, we examine the performance of these procedures in terms of sensitivity to detect voxel activation, using receiver operating characteristic curves. Second, we consider the accuracy of these spatial thresholding procedures in estimation of the size of the activation region, both in terms of bias and variance. The findings indicate that smoothing has the highest sensitivity to modest magnitude signals, but tend to overestimate the size of the activation region. Spatial mixture models estimate the size of a spatially distributed activation region well, but may be less sensitive to modest magnitude signals, indicating that additional research into more sensitive spatial mixture models is needed. Finally, the methods are illustrated with a real bilateral finger-tapping fMRI experiment.
18064633	Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is necessary for progression of autoimmune diabetes mellitus.	Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a proinflammatory cytokine of the innate immune system that plays a major role in the induction of immunoinflammatory responses. To examine the role of endogenous MIF in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes (TID) we evaluated the effects of administration of neutralizing anti-MIF antibodies to NOD mice with accelerated forms of diabetes induced by injection of cyclophosphamide or by transfer of diabetogenic spleen cells. Both accelerated forms of diabetes were markedly reduced by anti-MIF antibody. Furthermore, MIF-deficient (MIF(-/-)) mice were less susceptible to the induction of immunoinflammatory diabetes, insulitis and apoptosis within the endocrine pancreas by multiple low doses of streptozotocin (MLD-STZ) than genetically matched wild type (WT) mice. MIF deficiency resulted in lower proliferation and lymphocyte adhesion, as well as reduced production from the spleens and peritoneal cells of a variety of inflammatory mediators typically associated with development of the disease including IL-12, IL-23, TNF-alpha, and IL-1beta. Furthermore, MIF deletion affected the production of IL-18, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and iNOS in the islets of Langerhans. These data, along with the higher expression of IL-4 and TGF-beta observed in the periphery and in the pancreas of MLD-STZ-challenged MIF(-/-) mice as compared to WT controls suggest that MIF deficiency has induced an immune deviation towards protective type 2/3 response. These results suggest that MIF participates in T1D by controlling the functional activity of monocytes/macrophages and T cells and modulating their secretory capacity of pro- and anti-inflammatory molecules.
18065298	An HPLC-ICP-MS technique for determination of cadmium-phytochelatins in genetically modified Arabidopsis thaliana.	A reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic technique was developed to separate cadmium-phytochelatin complexes (Cd-PC2, Cd-PC3, and Cd-PC4) of interest in the plant Arapidopsis thaliana. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was coupled to an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometric (ICP-MS) system with some modification to the interface. This was done in order to sustain the plasma with optimum sensitivity for cadmium detection in the presence of the high methanol loads used in the gradient elution of the reversed-phase separation. The detection limits were found to be 91.8 ngl(-1), 77.2 ngl(-1) and 49.2 ngl(-1) for Cd-PC2, Cd-PC3, and Cd-PC4 respectively. The regression coefficients (r2) for Cd-PC2 to Cd-PC4 detection ranged from 0.998 to 0.999. The method was then used to investigate the occurrence and effect of cadmium-phytochelatin complexes in wild-type Arabidopsis and a phytochelatin-deficient mutant cad1-3 that had been genetically modified to ectopically express the wheat TaPCS1 phytochelatin synthase enzyme. The primary complex found in both wild-type and transgenic plants was Cd-PC2. In both lines, higher levels of Cd-PC2 were found in shoots than in roots, showing that phytochelatin synthases contribute to the accumulation of cadmium in shoots, in the Cd-PC2 form. Genetic modification did, however, impact the overall accumulation of Cd. Transgenic plants contained almost two times more cadmium in the form of Cd-PC2 in their roots than did the corresponding wild-type plants. Similarly, the shoot samples of the modified species also contained more (by 1.6 times) cadmium in the form of Cd-PC2 than the wild type. The enhanced role of PC2 in the transgenic Arabidopsis correlates with data showing long-distance transport of Cd in transgenic plants. Targeted transgenic expression of non-native phytochelatin synthases may contribute to improving the efficiency of plants for phytoremediation.

18065447	Stochastic severing of actin filaments by actin depolymerizing factor/cofilin controls the emergence of a steady dynamical regime.	Actin dynamics (i.e., polymerization/depolymerization) powers a large number of cellular processes. However, a great deal remains to be learned to explain the rapid actin filament turnover observed in vivo. Here, we developed a minimal kinetic model that describes key details of actin filament dynamics in the presence of actin depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilin. We limited the molecular mechanism to 1), the spontaneous growth of filaments by polymerization of actin monomers, 2), the ageing of actin subunits in filaments, 3), the cooperative binding of ADF/cofilin to actin filament subunits, and 4), filament severing by ADF/cofilin. First, from numerical simulations and mathematical analysis, we found that the average filament length, L, is controlled by the concentration of actin monomers (power law: 5/6) and ADF/cofilin (power law: -2/3). We also showed that the average subunit residence time inside the filament, T, depends on the actin monomer (power law: -1/6) and ADF/cofilin (power law: -2/3) concentrations. In addition, filament length fluctuations are approximately 20% of the average filament length. Moreover, ADF/cofilin fragmentation while modulating filament length keeps filaments in a high molar ratio of ATP- or ADP-P(i) versus ADP-bound subunits. This latter property has a protective effect against a too high severing activity of ADF/cofilin. We propose that the activity of ADF/cofilin in vivo is under the control of an affinity gradient that builds up dynamically along growing actin filaments. Our analysis shows that ADF/cofilin regulation maintains actin filaments in a highly dynamical state compatible with the cytoskeleton dynamics observed in vivo.
18065467	Stabilization of neurotoxic soluble beta-sheet-rich conformations of the Alzheimer's disease amyloid-beta peptide.	An emerging paradigm for degenerative diseases associated with protein misfolding, such as Alzheimer's disease, is the formation of a toxic species due to structural transitions accompanied by oligomerization. Increasingly, the focus in Alzheimer's disease is on soluble oligomeric forms of the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) as the potential toxic species. Using a variety of methods, we have analyzed how sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) modulates the folding of Abeta40 and 42 and found that submicellar concentrations of SDS solubilize Abeta and induce structural transitions. Under these conditions, Abeta40 and 42 are interconverting oligomeric ensembles with a predominantly beta-sheet structure. The Abeta42 soluble oligomers form beta-sheet structures more readily and have increased stability compared with Abeta40 under identical conditions. The presence of added Cu(2+) significantly promotes and stabilizes the formation of the soluble oligomeric beta-sheet structures but these structures are nonamyloidogenic. In contrast, in the absence of added Cu(2+), these beta-sheet oligomers possess the hallmarks of amyloidogenic structures. These SDS-induced beta-sheet forms of Abeta, both in the presence and absence of Cu(2+), are toxic to neuronal cells.
18065497	Ubiquitination of alpha-synuclein by Siah-1 promotes alpha-synuclein aggregation and apoptotic cell death.	Point mutations and gene multiplication of alpha-synuclein cause autosomal dominant familial Parkinson's disease (PD). Moreover, alpha-synuclein- and ubiquitin-positive inclusion bodies are the pathological hallmarks of PD and several other neurodegenerative diseases, such as dementia with Lewy bodies and multiple system atrophy. Despite the presence of ubiquitinated alpha-synuclein species in Lewy bodies, the regulation of alpha-synuclein ubiquitination and its role in Lewy body formation and neurodegeneration remain poorly understood. Here, we report that alpha-synuclein interacts and colocalizes with mammalian seven in absentia homologue-1 (Siah-1), a RING-type E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase. Siah-1 binds the brain-enriched E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UbcH8 and facilitates mono- and di-ubiquitination of alpha-synuclein in vivo. The ubiquitination of alpha-synuclein by Siah-1 is disrupted by the PD-linked A30P mutation but not by A53T mutation. We find that Siah-1-mediated ubiquitination does not target alpha-synuclein for degradation by the proteasome, but rather, it promotes alpha-synuclein aggregation and enhances alpha-synuclein toxicity. Our findings suggest that Siah-1-mediated alpha-synuclein ubiquitination may play a critical role in Lewy body formation and PD pathogenesis.
18065555	The contribution of photosynthesis to the red light response of stomatal conductance.	To determine the contribution of photosynthesis on stomatal conductance, we contrasted the stomatal red light response of wild-type tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum 'W38') with that of plants impaired in photosynthesis by antisense reductions in the content of either cytochrome b(6)f complex (anti-b/f plants) or Rubisco (anti-SSU plants). Both transgenic genotypes showed a lowered content of the antisense target proteins in guard cells as well as in the mesophyll. In the anti-b/f plants, CO(2) assimilation rates were proportional to leaf cytochrome b(6)f content, but there was little effect on stomatal conductance and the rate of stomatal opening. To compare the relationship between photosynthesis and stomatal conductance, wild-type plants and anti-SSU plants were grown at 30 and 300 micromol photon m(-2) s(-1) irradiance (low light and medium light [ML], respectively). Growth in ML increased CO(2) assimilation rates and stomatal conductance in both genotypes. Despite the significantly lower CO(2) assimilation rate in the anti-SSU plants, the differences in stomatal conductance between the genotypes were nonsignificant at either growth irradiance. Irrespective of plant genotype, stomatal density in the two leaf surfaces was 2-fold higher in ML-grown plants than in low-light-grown plants and conductance normalized to stomatal density was unaffected by growth irradiance. We conclude that the red light response of stomatal conductance is independent of the concurrent photosynthetic rate of the guard cells or of that of the underlying mesophyll. Furthermore, we suggest that the correlation of photosynthetic capacity and stomatal conductance observed under different light environments is caused by signals largely independent of photosynthesis.
18065763	Proteomic analysis of the cyanobacterium of the Azolla symbiosis: identity, adaptation, and NifH modification.	Cyanobacteria are able to form stable nitrogen-fixing symbioses with diverse eukaryotes. To extend our understanding of adaptations imposed by plant hosts, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry (MS) were used for comparative protein expression profiling of a cyanobacterium (cyanobiont) dwelling in leaf cavities of the water-fern Azolla filiculoides. Homology-based protein identification using peptide mass fingerprinting [matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF-MS)], tandem MS analyses, and sequence homology searches resulted in an identification success rate of 79% of proteins analysed in the unsequenced cyanobiont. Compared with a free-living strain, processes related to energy production, nitrogen and carbon metabolism, and stress-related functions were up-regulated in the cyanobiont while photosynthesis and metabolic turnover rates were down-regulated, stressing a slow heterotrophic mode of growth, as well as high heterocyst frequencies and nitrogen-fixing capacities. The first molecular data set on the nature of the NifH post-translational modification in cyanobacteria was also obtained: peptide mass spectra of the protein demonstrated the presence of a 300-400 Da protein modification localized to a specific 13 amino acid sequence, within the part of the protein that is ADP-ribosylated in other bacteria and close to the active site of nitrogenase. Furthermore, the distribution of the highest scoring database hits for the identified proteins points to the possibility of using proteomic data in taxonomy.
18066079	NMD factors UPF2 and UPF3 bridge UPF1 to the exon junction complex and stimulate its RNA helicase activity.	Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) eliminates mRNAs containing a premature translation termination codon through the recruitment of the conserved NMD factors UPF1, UPF2 and UPF3. In humans, a dynamic assembly pathway allows UPF1 to join UPF2 and UPF3 recruited to the mRNA by the exon-junction complex (EJC). Here we show that the recombinant EJC core is sufficient to reconstitute, with the three UPF proteins, a stable heptameric complex on RNA. The EJC proteins MAGOH, Y14 and eIF4AIII provide a composite binding site for UPF3b that serves as a bridge to UPF2 and UPF1. In the UPF trimeric complex, UPF2 and UPF3b cooperatively stimulate both ATPase and RNA helicase activities of UPF1. This work demonstrates that the EJC core is sufficient to stably anchor the UPF proteins to mRNA and provides insights into the regulation of its central effector, UPF1.
18066603	The reproductive assurance benefit of selfing: importance of flower size and population size.	Autonomous selfing can provide reproductive assurance (RA) for flowering plants that are unattractive to pollinators or in environments that are pollen limited. Pollen limitation may result from the breakdown of once-continuous habitat into smaller, more isolated patches (habitat fragmentation) if fragmentation negatively impacts pollinator populations. Here we quantify the levels of pollen limitation and RA among large and small populations of Collinsia parviflora, a wildflower with inter-population variation in flower size. We found that none of the populations were pollen limited, as pollen-supplemented and intact flowers did not differ in seed production. There was a significant effect of flower size on RA; intact flowers (can self) produced significantly more seeds than emasculated flowers (require pollen delivery) in small-flowered plants but not large-flowered plants. Population size nested within flower size did not significantly affect RA, but there was a large difference between our two replicate populations for large-flowered, small populations and small-flowered, large populations that appears related to a more variable pollination environment under these conditions. In fact, levels of RA were strongly negatively correlated with rates of pollinator visitation, whereby infrequent visitation by pollinators yielded high levels of RA via autonomous selfing, but there was no benefit of autonomous selfing when visitation rates were high. These results suggest that autonomous selfing may be adaptive in fragmented habitats or other ecological circumstances that affect pollinator visitation rates.
18066917	Body satisfaction, eating disorders and suicide ideation in an Internet sample of self-harmers reporting and not reporting childhood sexual abuse.	This study examined differences between self-harmers who had and who had not been sexually abused in childhood with regards to other risk factors and associated behaviours commonly identified in the research literature as being related to self-harm. Participants (N = 113, mean age = 19.92 years) were recruited via self-harm Internet discussion groups and message boards, and completed a web questionnaire assessing measures of body satisfaction, eating disorders, childhood trauma and suicide ideation. Self-harmers who reported a history of childhood sexual abuse scored higher on measures of body dissatisfaction, eating disorders, suicide ideation, physical abuse, physical neglect, emotional abuse and emotional neglect. These findings implicate sexual abuse as a powerful traumatic event that can have severe repercussions on an individual, not only in terms of self-harming behaviour but also in terms of developing a wide range of maladaptive behaviours in conjunction with self-harm.
18067247	Clustering millions of tandem mass spectra.	Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) experiments often generate redundant data sets containing multiple spectra of the same peptides. Clustering of MS/MS spectra takes advantage of this redundancy by identifying multiple spectra of the same peptide and replacing them with a single representative spectrum. Analyzing only representative spectra results in significant speed-up of MS/MS database searches. We present an efficient clustering approach for analyzing large MS/MS data sets (over 10 million spectra) with a capability to reduce the number of spectra submitted to further analysis by an order of magnitude. The MS/MS database search of clustered spectra results in fewer spurious hits to the database and increases number of peptide identifications as compared to regular nonclustered searches. Our open source software MS-Clustering is available for download at http://peptide.ucsd.edu or can be run online at http://proteomics.bioprojects.org/MassSpec.
18067320	Binding of the proline-rich segment of myelin basic protein to SH3 domains: spectroscopic, microarray, and modeling studies of ligand conformation and effects of posttranslational modifications.	Myelin basic protein (MBP) is a multifunctional protein involved in maintaining the stability and integrity of the myelin sheath by a variety of interactions with membranes and with cytoskeletal and other proteins. A central segment of MBP is highly conserved in mammals and consists of a membrane surface-associated amphipathic alpha-helix, immediately followed by a proline-rich segment that we hypothesize is an SH3 ligand. We show by circular dichroic spectroscopy that this proline-rich segment forms a polyproline type II helix in vitro under physiological conditions and that phosphorylation at a constituent threonyl residue has a stabilizing effect on its conformation. Using SH3 domain microarrays, we observe that the unmodified recombinant murine 18.5 kDa MBP isoform (rmC1 component) binds the following SH3 domains: Yes1 > PSD95 > cortactin = PexD = Abl = Fyn = c-Src = Itk in order of decreasing affinity. A quasi-deiminated form of the protein (rmC8) binds the SH3 domains Yes1 > Fyn > cortactin = c-Src > PexD = Abl. Phosphorylation of rmC1 at 1-2 threonines within the proline-rich segment by mitogen-activated protein kinase in vitro has no effect on the binding specificity to the SH3 domains on the array. An SH3 domain of chicken Fyn is also demonstrated to bind to lipid membrane-associated C1, phosphorylated C1, and rmC8. Molecular docking simulations of the interaction of the putative SH3 ligand of classic MBP with the human Fyn SH3 domain indicate that the strength of the interaction is of the same order of magnitude as with calmodulin and that the molecular recognition and association is mediated by some weak CH...pi interactions between the ligand prolyl residues and the aromatic ones of the SH3 binding site. One such interaction is well-conserved and involves the stacking of an MBP-peptide prolyl and an SH3 domain tryptophanyl residue, as in most other SH3-ligand complexes. Lysyl and arginyl residues in the peptide canonically interact via salt bridges and cation-pi interactions with negatively charged and aromatic residues in the SH3 domain binding site. Posttranslational modifications (phosphorylation or methylation) of the ligand cause noticeable shifts in the conformation of the flexible peptide and its side chains but do not predict any major inhibition of the binding beyond somewhat less favorable interactions for peptides with phosphorylated seryl or threonyl residues.
18067444	Entomological reactions to Darwin's theory in the nineteenth century.	Charles Darwin first became interested in entomology during his childhood, and this interest grew into a beetle-collecting obsession during his college days. Following the voyage of the Beagle, his focus on insects shifted from collecting specimens to searching for insect observations that supported his theory of natural selection as proposed in On the Origin of Species. Initially, Darwin believed that entomologists were opposed to his views. Using Darwin's correspondence, I show that his perception was based, in part, on three reviews, including one that he erroneously attributed to an entomological critic, and that not all entomologists were opposed to his ideas. Henry Walter Bates, discoverer of Batesian mimicry, voiced his support of Darwin in his papers and during meetings of the (now Royal) Entomological Society. In America, entomologist Benjamin D. Walsh wrote to Darwin in 1864, expressing his support and promising to counter any anti-Darwinian attack, and by 1868, Darwin was enjoying significant entomological support on both sides of the Atlantic. After his death in 1882, Darwin's supporters gained influence in Britain and the United States, completing entomology's shift to a Darwinian perspective.
18067505	Rh discrepancies caused by variable reactivity of partial and weak D types with different serologic techniques.	BACKGROUND: RhD discrepancies between current and historical results are problematic to resolve. The investigation of 10 discrepancies is reported here. STUDY DESIGN: Samples identified were those that reacted by automated gel technology and were negative with an FDA-approved reagent. Reactivity with a commercially available panel of monoclonal anti-D was performed. Genomic DNA was evaluated for RHD alleles with multiplex RHD exon polymerase chain reaction (PCR), weak D PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism, and RHD exon 5 and 7 sequence analyses. RESULTS: The monoclonal anti-D panel identified two samples as DVa, yet possessed the DAR allele. Two weak D Type 1 samples had a similar monoclonal anti-D profile, but only one reacted directly with one of two FDA-approved anti-D. Only two of four weak D Type 2 samples reacted directly with one FDA-approved anti-D, and their D epitope profile differed. CONCLUSIONS: The monoclonal anti-D reagents did not distinguish between partial and weak D Types 1 and 2. Weak D Types 1 and 2 do not show consistent reactivity with FDA-approved reagents and technology. To limit anti-D alloimmunization, it is recommended that samples yielding an immediate-spin tube test cutoff score of not more than 5 (i.e., < or =1+ agglutination) or a score of not more than 8 (i.e., < or =2+ hemagglutination) by gel technology be considered D- for transfusion and Rh immune globulin prophylaxis. That tube test anti-D reagents react poorly with some Weak D Types 1 and 2 red cells is problematic, inasmuch as they should be considered D+ for transfusion and prenatal care. Molecular tests that distinguish common partial and Weak D types provide the solution to resolving D antigen discrepancies.
18067532	Effect of exogenous GnRH at the time of artificial insemination on reproductive performance of Awassi ewes synchronized with progestagen-PMSG-PGF2alpha combination.	This study was carried out to investigate the efficacy of PGF(2alpha) for oestrus synchronization (ES) in Awassi ewes to which were administered the progestagen-PMSG combination, and to evaluate the effect of the exogenous GnRH administration immediately after the artificial insemination (AI) on their pregnancy rate and lambing performance during the breeding season. The ewes (n = 33) were treated with an intravaginal sponge impregnated with 30 mg fluorogestane acetate for 12 days and were injected with 500 IU PMSG at the time of removal of the sponge. The ewes were then divided into three equal groups of 11 ewes each. One millilitre of physiological saline (0.9% NaCl; placebo) was administered to each ewe in Group 1 at the time of second AI. Approximately 4 microg GnRH (busereline) was injected to each ewe in Group 2 immediately after second AI. A total of 150 microg PGF(2alpha) (cloprostenole) was injected at the time of sponge removal on day 12 and 4 microg GnRH immediately after the second AI was also treated to each ewe in Group 3. Intracervical AI with diluted fresh semen was performed twice at 12 and 24 h following the onset of oestrus. The injection-oestrus onset and injection-oestrus-end interval in Group 3 was significantly (p < 0.001) shorter than both Groups 1 and 2. Although the pregnancy rates of Groups 2 and 3 (81.8%; 9/11) were numerically higher than of Group 1 (63.6%; 7/11), the difference among the groups was statistically insignificant. The multiple birth rate of Group 3 was found higher than Groups 1 and 2. However, the number of single lambs of Group 1 was also higher than Groups 2 and 3 (p < 0.05). Despite the litter sizes of Groups 2 (1.27; 14/11) and 3 (1.55; 17/11) being numerically higher than Group 1 (0.73; 8/11), the differences among all the groups were statistically insignificant. In conclusion, the administration of PGF(2alpha) at the time of removal of the sponge shortens the injection oestrus-onset and oestrus-end interval in Awassi ewes treated with progestagen-PMSG. Additionally, exogenous GnRH treatment immediately after the AI increases the multiple birth rate of Awassi ewes synchronized with progestagen-PMSG-PGF(2alpha) combination.
18067539	Different regions of Mlc and NagC, homologous transcriptional repressors controlling expression of the glucose and N-acetylglucosamine phosphotransferase systems in Escherichia coli, are required for inducer signal recognition.	Mlc and NagC are two homologous transcription factors which bind to similar DNA targets but for which the inducing signals and mechanisms of activation are very different. Displacing Mlc from its DNA binding sites necessitates its sequestration to the inner membrane via an interaction with PtsG (EIICB(Glc)), while NagC is displaced from its DNA targets by interacting with GlcNAc6P. We have isolated mutations in both proteins which prevent the inactivation of the repressors by growth on glucose or GlcNAc. These mutations are located in different and specific regions of each protein. For Mlc changes at the C-terminal make it a constitutive repressor and also prevent it from binding to EIIB(Glc). Mutations in NagC, at positions which form a structural motif resembling a glucose binding site in Mlc, produce permanently repressing forms of NagC, suggesting that this motif forms a GlcNAc6P binding site in NagC. The pattern of repression by chimeric proteins of NagC and Mlc confirms the importance of the C-terminal region of Mlc for both repression and inducer binding and demonstrate that the helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif is not sufficient to determine the specificity of interaction of the repressor with DNA.
18067572	Reproductive conflicts affect labor and immune defense in the queenless ant Diacamma sp. "nilgiri".	In many species of social Hymenoptera, totipotency of workers induces potential conflicts over reproduction. However, actual conflicts remain rare despite the existence of a high reproductive skew. One of the current hypotheses assumes that conflicts are costly and thus selected against. We studied the costs of conflicts in 20 colonies of the queenless ant Diacamma sp. "nilgiri" by testing the effects of conflicts on labor and worker immunocompetence, two parameters closely linked to the indirect fitness of workers. In this species, the dominant female is the only mated worker (gamergate) and monopolizes reproduction. We experimentally induced conflicts by splitting each colony into two groups, a control group containing the gamergate and an orphaned group displaying aggressions until a new dominant worker arises. Immunocompetence was assessed by the clearance of Escherichia coli bacteria that we injected into the ants. Time budget analysis revealed a lower rate of labor and especially brood care in orphaned groups, supporting the existence of a cost of conflicts on labor. Fifteen days after splitting, a lower immunocompetence was also found in orphaned groups, which concerned workers involved and not involved in conflicts. We propose that this immunosuppression induced by conflicts could stem from stress and not directly from aggression.
18068224	Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is essential for development of zebrafish, Danio rerio.	Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) was discovered as the first cytokine that inhibited the random migration of macrophages. Recently, MIF has been reported to be involved in embryonic development in higher vertebrates. In fish, however, nothing is known about the function of MIF at early life stages, although immunological functions of MIF have been reported in adult fish. To elucidate the function of MIF during embryonic development in fish, we examined expression patterns and function of the zebrafish MIF gene using antisense morpholino-mediated knockdown (morpholino oligonucleotide-MO). In whole-mount in situ hybridization analysis, zebrafish MIF mRNA was detected in developing eyes, tectum, branchial arches, pectoral fin buds, liver and gut. The onset of MIF mRNA expression coincided with the beginning of tissue differentiation during embryogenesis. MIF-MO-injected embryos (morphants) displayed malformed eyes, abnormal swelling in the tectum and fourth ventricle region, and undeveloped jaw cartilage and pectoral fins. An increased number of apoptotic cells in the eye and neural tissues were observed in MIF morphants by histological analysis and acridine orange staining. Moreover, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells were reduced in morphant eyes. These results suggest that MIF is essential for normal embryonic development even at the level of teleosts and that it functions as a growth factor for the proliferation and differentiation of embryonic tissues.
18068536	Amplification of BCR-ABL and t(3;21) in a patient with blast crisis of chronic myelogenous leukemia.	The Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome, or t(9;22), is the hallmark of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). It results in juxtaposition of the 5' part of the BCR gene on chromosome 22 to the 3' part of the ABL1 gene (previously ABL) on chromosome 9. CML is clinically characterized by three distinct phases: chronic, accelerated, and blast phase. Blast crisis is characterized by the rapid expansion of a population of differentiation arrested blast cells (myeloid or lymphoid cells population), with secondary chromosomal abnormalities present. We report a case of myeloid blast crisis of CML resistant to imatinib mesylate and chemotherapy. By use of cytogenetic, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and comparative genomic hybridization methods, we identified a cluster of BCR-ABL amplification on inverted duplication of the Ph chromosome with t(3;21)(q26;q22) and increased genomic levels of the RUNX1 gene (previously AML1). The t(3;21)(q26;q22) is a recurrent chromosomal abnormality in some cases of CML blast phase and in treatment-related myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia. Amplification or copy number increase of RUNX1 has been reported in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Our study indicated that the progenitor of CML was BCR-ABL dependent through the amplification of Ph chromosome as a mechanism of resistance to imatinib therapy. The coexistence of BCR-ABL and t(3;21)(q26;q22) with RUNX1 rearrangement might play a pivotal role in the CML blast transformation.
18068685	Bionomics of malaria vectors and relationship with malaria transmission and epidemiology in three physiographic zones in the Senegal River Basin.	Following the implementation of two dams in the Senegal River, entomological and parasitological studies were conducted in three different ecological zones in the Senegal River Basin (the low valley of Senegal River, the Guiers Lake area and the low valley of Ferlo) every 3 month in June 2004, September 2004, December 2004 and March 2005. The objective of this work was to study the influence of environmental heterogeneities on vector bionomics and malaria epidemiology. Mosquitoes were collected when landing on human volunteers and by pyrethrum spray catches. In the parasitological survey, blood samples were taken from a cohort of schoolchildren under 9 years during each entomology survey. Seven anopheline species were collected: Anopheles arabiensis, Anopheles gambiae M form, Anopheles funestus, Anopheles pharoensis, Anopheles coustani, Anopheles wellcomei and Anopheles rufipes. A. arabiensis, A. funestus and A. pharoensis were predominant in the low valley of the Senegal River, A. funestus in the Guiers Lake area and A. arabiensis in the low valley of Ferlo. Mosquito populations' dynamics varied temporally depending on the rainy season for each zone. The anthropophilic rates varied between 6 and 76% for A. gambiae s.l. and 23 and 80% for A. funestus. Only 4/396 A. pharoensis and 1/3076 A. funestus tested carried Plasmodium falciparum CS antigen. These results suggest the implication of A. pharoensis in malaria transmission. The related entomological inoculation rates were estimated to 10.44 in Mbilor and 3 infected bites in Gankette Balla and were due, respectively, to A. pharoensis and A. funestus. Overall, 1636 thick blood smears were tested from blood samples taken from schoolchildren with, respectively, a parasite and gametocyte average prevalence of 9 and 0.9%. The parasite prevalence was uniformly low in Mbilor and Gankette Balla whereas; it increased in September (16%) and then remained stable in December and March (22%) in Mboula where malaria transmission was not perceptible. However, significant differences were observed over time for parasite prevalence in Mbilor and Mboula villages whereas; it was only in Gankette Balla village where gametocyte prevalence was significantly different over time. Our study demonstrates the influence of ecological changes resulted from dams implementation in the Senegal River on the composition of vectorial system, malaria transmission and epidemiology. Such changes should be thoroughly surveyed in order to prevent any possible malaria outbreak in the Senegal River Basin.
18068723	A new cryo-EM single-particle ab initio reconstruction method visualizes secondary structure elements in an ATP-fueled AAA+ motor.	The generation of ab initio three-dimensional (3D) models is a bottleneck in the studies of large macromolecular assemblies by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. We describe here a novel method, in which established methods for two-dimensional image processing are combined with newly developed programs for joint rotational 3D alignment of a large number of class averages (RAD) and calculation of 3D volumes from aligned projections (VolRec). We demonstrate the power of the method by reconstructing an approximately 660-kDa ATP-fueled AAA+ motor to 7.5 A resolution, with secondary structure elements identified throughout the structure. We propose the method as a generally applicable automated strategy to obtain 3D reconstructions from unstained single particles imaged in vitreous ice.
18068897	Effect of landfill leachate on cell cycle, micronucleus, and sister chromatid exchange in Triticum aestivum.	With increasing use of municipal solid waste landfills for waste disposal, the leachate generated has become a serious environmental concern. Therefore, it is important to set up simple and accurate methods for monitoring leachate toxicity. In the present study, the physiological and genetic toxicity of the leachate, generated from Xingou Municipal Landfill in China, were investigated with Triticum aestivum (wheat) bioassay. The results indicate that the lower leachate concentrations stimulated the germination, growth and cell division, and did not induce obvious increase in micronucleus (MN) frequency in root tips; while the higher concentrations inhibited the processes, and significantly augmented the MN frequency in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. In addition, pycnotic cells (PNC) and sister chromatid exchange (SCE) occurred in root tips at all leachate concentrations tested, and the frequencies had positive relation with the treatment concentration and time. The results imply that components of leachate from the landfill may be genotoxic in plant cells, and exposure to leachate in the aquatic environment may pose a potential genotoxic risk to organisms. The results also suggest that the wheat bioassay is efficient, simple and reproducible in monitoring genotoxicity of the leachate.
18068921	Animal models to test drugs with potential antidiabetic activity.	Although medicinal plants have been historically used for diabetes treatment throughout the world, few of them have been validated by scientific criteria. Recently, a large diversity of animal models has been developed to better understand the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus and new drugs have been introduced in the market to treat this disease. The aim of this work was to review the available animal models of diabetes and some in vitro models which have been used as tools to investigate the mechanism of action of drugs with potential antidiabetic properties. In addition, a MEDLINE/PUBMED search for articles on natural products, pancreatectomy and diabetes mellitus treatment published between 1996 and 2006 was done. In the majority of the studies, natural products mainly derived from plants have been tested in diabetes models induced by chemical agents. This review contributes to the researcher in the ethnopharmacology field to designs new strategies for the development of novel drugs to treat this serious condition that constitutes a global public health.
18068989	Radiation-induced optic neuropathy.	Radiation-induced optic neuropathy (RION) is a devastating late complication of radiotherapy to the anterior visual pathway resulting in acute, profound, irreversible visual loss. It is thought to be a result of radiation necrosis of the anterior visual pathway. Visual loss may be unilateral or bilateral; simultaneous or sequential. RION occurs commonly between 10-20 months, with an average of 18 months after treatment; but the onset may range from three months to 9 years. Cumulative doses of radiation that exceed 50 Gy or single doses to the anterior visual pathway or greater than 10 Gy are usually required for RION to develop. Several factors are associated with a higher risk for developing RION or for RION occurring with lower total doses of radiation. These include age, pre-existing compression of the optic nerve and chiasm by tumour, concurrent chemotherapy or previous external beam radiation. MRI, the investigation of choice for identifying radiation injury to the visual pathway, may show abnormalities before the loss of vision. Typically, the unenhanced T1- and T2-weighted images show no abnormality, but the optic nerve will show enhancement on T1-weighted images with MRI. Treatment with systemic corticosteroids, anticoagulation and hyperbaric oxygen has been generally unsuccessful and disappointing. If visual dysfunction is detected early, hyperbaric oxygen might be beneficial if treatment is initiated within 72 hours of visual loss. Because of the poor prognosis associated with RION, the risk of its potential development should be factored into the decision to irradiate the brain.
18068995	High spatial resolution surface imaging and analysis of fungal cells using SEM and AFM.	We review the use of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and force spectroscopy (FS) for probing the ultrastructure, chemistry, physical characteristics and motion of fungal cells. When first developed, SEM was used to image fixed/dehydrated/gold coated specimens, but here we describe more recent SEM developments as they apply to fungal cells. CryoSEM offers high resolution for frozen fungal samples, whereas environmental SEM allows the analysis of robust samples (e.g. spores) under ambient conditions. Dual beam SEM, the most recently developed, adds manipulation capabilities along with element detection. AFM has similar lateral and better depth resolution compared to SEM, and can image live cells including growing fungal hyphae. FS can analyze cell wall chemistry, elasticity and dynamic cell characteristics. The integration of AFM with optical microscopy will allow examination of individual molecules or cellular structures in the context of fungal cell architecture. SEM and AFM are complementary techniques that are clarifying our understanding of fungal biology.
18069081	Impulsivity is associated with the disinhibition but not restraint factor from the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire.	Recent data implicate impulsivity as a personality trait associated with obesity, binge eating and restrained eating. However, impulsivity is recognised as having multiple dimensions, and it remains unclear which aspects of impulsive behaviour best predict disordered eating. To try and elucidate further the relationship between impulsivity and eating behaviour, 147 women completed a behavioural measure and two self-report measures of impulsivity along with the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ). Overall scores on the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-II), along with scores on the Non-planning and Motor Subscales of the BIS-II, were higher in women scoring high on the TFEQ disinhibition (TFEQ-D) scale. Likewise, women scoring high on the TFEQ-D showed more impulsive choice when discounting hypothetical monetary awards. However, responses to measures of functional relative to dysfunctional impulsivity did not differ depending on TFEQ-D score. No measure of impulsivity was related to scores on the TFEQ restraint scale. These data suggest that a tendency to act impulsively is associated with a tendency to overeat, and may be a factor which predicts the likelihood of the development of binge eating and the breakdown of dieting.
18069087	The effectiveness of disaster training for health care workers: a systematic review.	STUDY OBJECTIVE: Evidence-based medical literature is lacking about the best methods to train health care providers in disaster response. We systematically review the recent literature to report whether training interventions in disaster preparedness improve knowledge and skills in disaster response. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE through PubMed, ISI Web of Science, BIOSIS, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL), the Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, the Public Affairs Information Service, and Education Full Text. Selected journals, articles, and other comprehensive reports were also reviewed for relevant citations. Subjects of eligible articles were hospital-based and out-of-hospital health care providers. Articles meeting inclusion criteria were published in English between January 2000 and December 2005, described a training exercise undertaken to further knowledge or skills in disaster response, measured a quantitative and objective outcome, and used a control group. Included studies were independently reviewed by 2 researchers, and study quality was assessed with criteria adapted from the US Preventive Services Task Force and the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination. RESULTS: We identified 258 studies. Nine studies are included in this review. Computer- and lecture-based training interventions may be effective in increasing disaster-related knowledge for out-of-hospital providers, though questions about study design and quality may cast doubt on the results. Evidence about effectiveness of training for inhospital providers is inconclusive. Comparison across studies is difficult because of diversity in study subjects, designs, and interventions. Results are likely biased by contamination from outside events. CONCLUSION: The available evidence is insufficient to determine whether training interventions for health care providers are effective in improving knowledge and skills in disaster response.
18069668	Automated recognition system to classify subcellular protein localizations in images of different cell lines acquired by different imaging systems.	Systemic analysis of subcellular protein localization (location proteomics) provides clues for understanding gene functions and physiological condition of the cells. However, recognition of cell images of subcellular structures highly depends on experience and becomes the rate-limiting step when classifying subcellular protein localization. Several research groups have extracted specific numerical features for the recognition of subcellular protein localization, but these recognition systems are restricted to images of single particular cell line acquired by one specific imaging system and not applied to recognize a range of cell image sources. In this study, we establish a single system for automated subcellular structure recognition to identify cell images from various sources. Two different sources of cell images, 317 Vero (http://gfp-cdna.embl.de) and 875 CHO cell images of subcellular structures, were used to train and test the system. When the system was trained by a single source of images, the recognition rate is high and specific to the trained source. The system trained by the CHO cell images gave high average recognition accuracy for CHO cells of 96%, but this was reduced to 46% with Vero images. When we trained the system using a mixture of CHO and Vero cell images, an average accuracy of recognition reached 86.6% for both CHO and Vero cell images. The system can reject images with low confidence and identify the cell images correctly recognized to avoid manual reconfirmation. In summary, we have established a single system that can recognize subcellular protein localizations from two different sources for location-proteomic studies. studies.
18069876	PX DNA triangle oligomerized using a novel three-domain motif.	Structural DNA nanotechnology is directed at building objects, lattices, and arrays from cohesive interactions between DNA molecules. The predominant means of doing this takes advantage of the information inherent in Watson-Crick base pairing in duplex formation and in sticky-ended cohesion. Nevertheless, other forms of nucleic acid cohesion are also known, particularly paranemic edge-sharing interactions (PX). Here we report the formation of a triangular species that has four strands per edge, held together by PX interactions. We demonstrate by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis and by atomic force microscopy (AFM) that we can combine a partial triangle with other strands to form a four-stranded molecule that is robust. By combining them with a new mixed-fusion type of three-domain molecule, we demonstrate by AFM that these triangles can be self-assembled into a linear array.
18069943	Not all ALMT1-type transporters mediate aluminum-activated organic acid responses: the case of ZmALMT1 - an anion-selective transporter.	The phytotoxic effects of aluminum (Al) on root systems of crop plants constitute a major agricultural problem in many areas of the world. Root exudation of Al-chelating molecules such as low-molecular-weight organic acids has been shown to be an important mechanism of plant Al tolerance/resistance. Differences observed in the physiology and electrophysiology of root function for two maize genotypes with contrasting Al tolerance revealed an association between rates of Al-activated root organic acid release and Al tolerance. Using these genotypes, we cloned ZmALMT1, a maize gene homologous to the wheat ALMT1 and Arabidopsis AtALMT1 genes that have recently been described as encoding functional, Al-activated transporters that play a role in tolerance by mediating Al-activated organic acid exudation in roots. The ZmALMT1 cDNA encodes a 451 amino acid protein containing six transmembrane helices. Transient expression of a ZmALMT1::GFP chimera confirmed that the protein is targeted to the plant cell plasma membrane. We addressed whether ZmALMT1 might underlie the Al-resistance response (i.e. Al-activated citrate exudation) observed in the roots of the Al-tolerant genotype. The physiological, gene expression and functional data from this study confirm that ZmALMT1 is a plasma membrane transporter that is capable of mediating elective anion efflux and influx. However, gene expression data as well as biophysical transport characteristics obtained from Xenopus oocytes expressing ZmALMT1 indicate that this transporter is implicated in the selective transport of anions involved in mineral nutrition and ion homeostasis processes, rather than mediating a specific Al-activated citrate exudation response at the rhizosphere of maize roots.
18069986	Atomic property fields: generalized 3D pharmacophoric potential for automated ligand superposition, pharmacophore elucidation and 3D QSAR.	The atomic property fields (APF) concept is introduced as a continuous, multi-component 3D potential that reflects preferences for various atomic properties at each point in space. Atomic property field-based approaches to several key problems in the field of ligand structure-based rational drug discovery and design are investigated. The superposition of ligands on one or multiple molecular templates is performed by Monte-Carlo minimization in the atomic property fields potentials combined with standard force-field energy. The approach is extended to multiple flexible ligand alignments using an iterative procedure, Self-Consistent atomic Property Fields by Optimization (SCAPFOld). The application of atomic property fields and SCAPFOld for virtual ligand screening and 3D Quantitive Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) is tested on published benchmarks. The new methods are shown to perform competitively in comparison to current state-of-the-art methods.
18069988	Bayesian screening for active compounds in high-dimensional chemical spaces combining property descriptors and molecular fingerprints.	Bayesian classifiers are increasingly being used to distinguish active from inactive compounds and search large databases for novel active molecules. We introduce an approach to directly combine the contributions of property descriptors and molecular fingerprints in the search for active compounds that is based on a Bayesian framework. Conventionally, property descriptors and fingerprints are used as alternative features for virtual screening methods. Following the approach introduced here, probability distributions of descriptor values and fingerprint bit settings are calculated for active and database molecules and the divergence between the resulting combined distributions is determined as a measure of biological activity. In test calculations on a large number of compound activity classes, this methodology was found to consistently perform better than similarity searching using fingerprints and multiple reference compounds or Bayesian screening calculations using probability distributions calculated only from property descriptors. These findings demonstrate that there is considerable synergy between different types of property descriptors and fingerprints in recognizing diverse structure-activity relationships, at least in the context of Bayesian modeling.
18070012	Psychological comorbidity and complexity of gastrointestinal symptoms in clinically diagnosed irritable bowel syndrome patients.	BACKGROUND AND AIM: The prevalence of psychological disorders is high in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) but their role in symptom reporting is uncertain. It is thus interesting whether the number of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) determines the load of psychological comorbidity. The Rome III criteria have not been used to evaluate such a relationship as yet. Moreover, not many studies have examined the sensitivity of the Rome III criteria in detecting IBS. Our aims were therefore: (i) to determine whether those IBS participants with more FGID had a tendency to greater psychological comorbidity than those with fewer FGID; and (ii) to assess the performance of the Rome III criteria in detecting IBS versus the diagnosis of the gastroenterologist. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of 32 consecutive outpatients with clinically diagnosed IBS was performed. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Short Form 12 Health Survey (SF-12), and the Rome III criteria questionnaire (BDQ-6) were administered. Multiple linear regression was conducted to detect associations among FGID, anxiety, depression and quality of life. RESULTS: Overall, 50% of participants were anxious and 12% were depressed. Forty-four percent of participants had >two FGID; however, the number of FGID did not correlate with scores for anxiety, depression or quality of life. Amazingly, only 50% (CI: 33-67) of participants clinically diagnosed with IBS met Rome III criteria for IBS. CONCLUSION: Contrary to our expectations, a greater load of FGID did not correlate with a greater load of psychological comorbidity. Surprisingly, the Rome III criteria detected only 50% of clinical cases of IBS.
18070067	Sigma factors in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.	In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as in most bacterial species, the expression of genes is tightly controlled by a repertoire of transcriptional regulators, particularly the so-called sigma (sigma) factors. The basic understanding of these proteins in bacteria has initially been described in Escherichia coli where seven sigma factors are involved in core RNA polymerase interactions and promoter recognition. Now, 7 years have passed since the completion of the first genome sequence of the opportunistic pathogen P. aeruginosa. Information from the genome of P. aeruginosa PAO1 identified 550 transcriptional regulators and 24 putative sigma factors. Of the 24 sigma, 19 were of extracytoplasmic function (ECF). Here, basic knowledge of sigma and ECF proteins was reviewed with particular emphasis on their role in P. aeruginosa global gene regulation. Summarized data are obtained from in silico analysis of P. aeruginosasigma and ECF including rpoD (sigma(70)), RpoH (sigma(32)), RpoF (FliA or sigma(28)), RpoS (sigma(S) or sigma(38)), RpoN (NtrA, sigma(54) or sigma(N)), ECF including AlgU (RpoE or sigma(22)), PvdS, SigX and a collection of uncharacterized sigma ECF, some of which are implicated in iron transport. Coupled to systems biology, identification and functional genomics analysis of P. aeruginosasigma and ECF are expected to provide new means to prevent infection, new targets for antimicrobial therapy, as well as new insights into the infection process.
18070104	Trehalose and anhydrobiosis in tardigrades--evidence for divergence in responses to dehydration.	To withstand desiccation, many invertebrates such as rotifers, nematodes and tardigrades enter a state known as anhydrobiosis, which is thought to require accumulation of compatible osmolytes, such as the non-reducing disaccharide trehalose to protect against dehydration damage. The trehalose levels of eight tardigrade species comprising Heterotardigrada and Eutardigrada were observed in five different states of hydration and dehydration. Although many species accumulate trehalose during dehydration, the data revealed significant differences between the species. Although trehalose accumulation was found in species of the order Parachela (Eutardigrada), it was not possible to detect any trehalose in the species Milnesium tardigradum and no change in the trehalose level has been observed in any species of Heterotardigrada so far investigated. These results expand our current understanding of anhydrobiosis in tardigrades and, for the first time, demonstrate the accumulation of trehalose in developing tardigrade embryos, which have been shown to have a high level of desiccation tolerance.
18070147	BRAF mutation associated with other genetic events identifies a subset of aggressive papillary thyroid carcinoma.	PURPOSE: BRAF(V600E) mutation represents the most common oncogenic event in sporadic papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). There are, however, significant discrepancies regarding the overall frequency, its prevalence in PTC-variants, and its relationship with clinico-pathological parameters of poor outcome. Moreover, the impact of BRAF(V600E) mutants on tumour-related patient's death has not been evaluated. DESIGN: We analysed, by PCR-SSCP and/or PCR-direct sequencing, exons 8, 10, 11 and 15 of BRAF in 113 tumour samples from 49 PTC-patients. Matched lymph node metastases and/or distant metastases (DMs) were screened in 35 patients. Focal changes in the growth pattern or microscopic grade within the primary tumour (Pt) or the metastases were separately genotyped. Mutations at H-, K-, N-ras and PIK3CA exons 9 and 20 were also investigated. For comparison with PTC cases, the BRAF and Ras mutational status was evaluated in 89 specimens obtained from 24 poorly differentiated thyroid carcinomas (PDCs) and 36 anaplastic thyroid carcinomas (ATCs). RESULTS: BRAF(V600E) was found in 13/16 classical PTCs (CL-PTCs), 6/17 follicular variant PTCs (FV-PTCs) and 8/16 mixed (papillary/follicular) PTCs (Mx-PTCs), being significantly associated with CL-PTCs (P = 0.015). BRAF(V600E) segregated with metastatic PTC-cells in 43% of the patients, but only one DM disclosed the mutation. PTC-tumours featuring concurrent less-differentiated foci were BRAF wild-type in both components. Noteworthy, the frequency of BRAF mutations among PDCs and ATCs resulted considerably lower (16.6% and 25%, respectively) than in PTCs (55%). The prevalence of Ras mutations among PDCs and ATCs (46% and 36%, respectively) was, however, much higher than in PTCs (14%). Five (71%) of the patients who died of PTC displayed somatic mutations. Four of them had other gene alteration associated with BRAF(V600E) and the only one that did not, BRAF(V600E) was restricted to the Pt. The occurrence of BRAF(V600E) associated with other genetic events was an independent predictor of DMs during follow-up, recurrence and tumour-related death. Remarkably, two PDCs (8.3%) and five ATCs (14%) revealed concurrent BRAF and Ras mutations. CONCLUSION: BRAF(V600E)'alone' does not represent a marker for poor outcome, however, when associated with alterations in other genes identifies a subset of PTCs with increased risk of recurrence and decreased survival.
18070196	Initial clinical experience with real-time transrectal ultrasonography-magnetic resonance imaging fusion-guided prostate biopsy.	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility and utility of registration and fusion of real-time transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) and previously acquired magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to guide prostate biopsies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two National Cancer Institute trials allowed MRI-guided (with or with no US fusion) prostate biopsies during placement of fiducial markers. Fiducial markers were used to guide patient set-up for daily external beam radiation therapy. The eligible patients had biopsy-confirmed prostate cancer that was visible on MRI. A high-field (3T) MRI was performed with an endorectal coil in place. After moving to an US suite, the patient then underwent TRUS to visualize the prostate. The US transducer was equipped with a commercial needle guide and custom modified with two embedded miniature orthogonal five-degrees of freedom sensors to enable spatial tracking and registration with MR images in six degrees of freedom. The MRI sequence of choice was registered manually to the US using custom software for real-time navigation and feedback. The interface displayed the actual and projected needle pathways superimposed upon the real-time US blended with the prior MR images, with position data updating in real time at 10 frames per second. The registered MRI information blended to the real-time US was available to the physician who performed targeted biopsies of highly suspicious areas. RESULTS: Five patients underwent limited focal biopsy and fiducial marker placement with real-time TRUS-MRI fusion. The Gleason scores at the time of enrollment on study were 8, 7, 9, 9, and 6. Of the 11 targeted biopsies, eight showed prostate cancer. Positive biopsies were found in all patients. The entire TRUS procedure, with fusion, took approximately 10 min. CONCLUSION: The fusion of real-time TRUS and prior MR images of the prostate is feasible and enables MRI-guided interventions (like prostate biopsy) outside of the MRI suite. The technique allows for navigation within dynamic contrast-enhanced maps, or T2-weighted or MR spectroscopy images. This technique is a rapid way to facilitate MRI-guided prostate therapies such as external beam radiation therapy, brachytherapy, cryoablation, high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation, or direct injection of agents, without the cost, throughput, or equipment compatibility issues that might arise with MRI-guided interventions inside the MRI suite.
18070608	Function and redox state of mitochondrial localized cysteine-rich proteins important in the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase.	The cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) complex of the mitochondrial respiratory chain exists within the mitochondrial inner membrane (IM). The biogenesis of the complex is a multi-faceted process requiring multiple assembly factors that function on both faces of the IM. Formation of the two copper centers of CcO occurs within the intermembrane space (IMS) and is dependent on assembly factors with critical cysteinyl thiolates. Two classes of assembly factors exist, one group being soluble IMS proteins and the second class being proteins tethered to the IM. A common motif in the soluble assembly factors is a duplicated Cx(9)C sequence motif. Since mitochondrial respiration is a major source of reactive oxygen species, control of the redox state of mitochondrial proteins is an important process. This review documents the role of these cysteinyl CcO assembly factors within the IMS and the necessity of redox control in their function.
18070805	The clinical utility of screening of biochemical parameters in elite athletes: analysis of 100 cases.	OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical utility of screening for biochemical parameters in elite athletes. DESIGN: A prospective sequential case series. SETTING: The Department of Sports Medicine at the Australian Institute of Sport. PARTICIPANTS: 100 elite athletes from 11 sports (56 male and 44 female athletes, mean age 19 years, range 16-27), undergoing routine medical screening. INTERVENTION: Initial and follow-up assessment of the following biochemical parameters in association with clinical assessment; serum iron, ferritin, transferrin, percent transferrin saturation, sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, urate, urea and creatinine, total protein, albumin, creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransaminase (AST), alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, total bilirubin, cholesterol and triglycerides (non-fasting), and random glucose. RESULTS: 18 athletes showed no abnormalities on biochemical screening. 194 abnormal results were found in 82 athletes. 115 abnormalities were noted in 46 male and 79 in 36 female athletes. In 43 individual tests, the results did not return to normal on repeat testing. The most common abnormalities were increases in AST (27%), phosphate (13%), CK (13%), urea (12%) and bilirubin (12%). Three cases of hypercholesterolaemia and one case of haemochromatosis were identified, and one athlete, who was asymptomatic, was diagnosed with Epstein-Barr virus infection, which was suspected because of an abnormal liver function test. The other abnormalities found appeared not to be of clinical significance. CONCLUSION: Most abnormalities found on routine biochemical screening in elite athletes are of no clinical significance, therefore such testing should, if used only for clinical purposes, be abandoned. When athletes are tested for iron status it would be prudent to include assessment of serum cholesterol in those with a family history of hyperlipidaemia.
18070889	Streptococcus pneumoniae choline-binding protein E interaction with plasminogen/plasmin stimulates migration across the extracellular matrix.	The virulence mechanisms leading Streptococcus pneumoniae to convert from nasopharyngeal colonization to a tissue-invasive phenotype are still largely unknown. Proliferation of infection requires penetration of the extracellular matrix, which occurs by recruitment of host proteases to the bacterial cell surface. We present evidence supporting the role of choline-binding protein E (CBPE) (a member of the surface-exposed choline-binding protein family) as an important receptor for human plasminogen, the precursor of plasmin. The results of ligand overlay blot analyses, solid-phase binding assays, and surface plasmon resonance experiments support the idea of an interaction between CBPE and plasminogen. We have shown that the phosphorylcholine esterase (Pce) domain of CBPE interacts with the plasminogen kringle domains. Analysis of the crystal structure of the Pce domain, followed by site-directed mutagenesis, allowed the identification of the plasminogen-binding region composed in part by lysine residues, some of which map in a linear fashion on the surface of the Pce domain. The biological relevance of the CBPE-plasminogen interaction is supported by the fact that, compared to the wild-type strain, a mutant of pneumococcus with the cbpE gene deleted (i) displays a reduced level of plasminogen binding and plasmin activation and (ii) shows reduced ability to cross the extracellular matrix in an in vitro model. These results support the idea of a physiological role for the CBPE-plasminogen interaction in pneumococcal dissemination into human tissue.
18071335	Transcriptional activities of the Sleeping Beauty transposon and shielding its genetic cargo with insulators.	The Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposable element shows efficient transposition in human cells, and provides long-term transgene expression in preclinical animal models. Random chromosomal insertion of SB vectors represents a safety issue in human gene therapeutic applications, due to potential genotoxic effects associated with transposon integration. We investigated the transcriptional activities of SB in order to assess its potential to alter host gene expression upon integration. The untranslated regions (UTRs) of the transposon direct convergent, inward-directed transcription. Transcription from the 5'-UTR of SB is upregulated by the host-encoded factor high-mobility group 2-like 1 (HMG2L1), and requires a 65-base pair (bp) region not present in commonly used SB vectors. The SB transposase antagonizes the effect of HMG2L1, suggesting that natural transposase expression is under a negative feedback regulation. SB transposon vectors lacking the 65-bp region associated with HMG2L1-dependent upregulation exhibit benign transcriptional activities, at a level up to 100-times lower than that of the murine leukemia virus (MLV) long terminal repeat (LTR). Incorporation of chicken beta-globin HS4 insulator sequences in SB-based vectors reduces the transactivation of model promoters by transposon-borne enhancers, and thus may lower the risk of transcriptional activation of host genes situated close to a transposon insertion site.
18071659	Dendritic cell subsets and toll-like receptors.	Toll-like receptors exist as highly conserved pathogen sensors throughout the animal kingdom and they represent a key family of molecules bridging the ancient innate and adaptive immune systems. The first molecules of adaptive immunity appeared in the cartilaginous fishes and, with these, major histocompatibility proteins and cells expressing these molecules, and thus, by definition, the advent of antigen-presenting cells and the "professional" antigen-presenting cells, the dendritic cells. Dendritic cells themselves are highly specialized subsets of cells with the major roles of antigen presentation and stimulation of lymphocytes. The dendritic cell functions of inducing immunity are regulated by their own activation status, which is governed by their encounter with pathogen-associated molecular patterns that signal through pattern recognition receptors, including Toll-like receptors, expressed at the surface and within the cytoplasm and endosomal membranes of dendritic cells. Thus although dendritic cells play a crucial role in the induction of adaptive immunity, the adaptive response is itself initiated at the level of ancient receptors of the innate immune system. A further degree in the complexity of dendritic cell activation is established by the fact that not all dendritic cells are equal. Dendritic cells exist as multiple subsets that vary in location, function, and phenotype. Distinct dendritic cell subsets display great variation in the type of Toll-like receptors expressed and consequently variation in the type of pathogens sensed and the subsequent type of immune responses initiated.
18071668	Mapping quantitative trait loci associated with barley net blotch resistance.	Net blotch of barley, caused by Pyrenophora teres Drechs., is an important foliar disease worldwide. Deployment of resistant cultivars is the most economic and eco-friendly control method. This report describes mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with net blotch resistance in a doubled-haploid (DH) barley population using diversity arrays technology (DArT) markers. One hundred and fifty DH lines from the cross CDC Dolly (susceptible)/TR251 (resistant) were screened as seedlings in controlled environments with net-form net blotch (NFNB) isolates WRS858 and WRS1607 and spot-form net blotch (SFNB) isolate WRS857. The population was also screened at the adult-plant stage for NFNB resistance in the field in 2005 and 2006. A high-density genetic linkage map of 90 DH lines was constructed using 457 DArT and 11 SSR markers. A major NFNB seedling resistance QTL, designated QRpt6, was mapped to chromosome 6H for isolates WRS858 and WRS1607. QRpt6 was associated with adult-plant resistance in the 2005 and 2006 field trials. Additional QTL for NFNB seedling resistance to the more virulent isolate WRS858 were identified on chromosomes 2H, 4H, and 5H. A seedling resistance QTL (QRpts4) for the SFNB isolate WRS857 was detected on chromosome 4H as was a significant QTL (QRpt7) on chromosome 7H. Three QTL (QRpt6, QRpts4, QRpt7) were associated with resistance to both net blotch forms and lines with one or more of these demonstrated improved resistance. Simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers tightly linked to QRpt6 and QRpts4 were identified and validated in an unrelated barley population. The major 6H QTL, QRpt6, may provide adequate NFNB field resistance in western Canada and could be routinely selected for using molecular markers in a practical breeding program.
18071707	The role of cytokines in inflammatory response after total knee arthroplasty in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.	Surgery and trauma is accompanied by changes in blood levels of certain cytokines and chemokines including interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-8 (IL-8). However, there is little data on correlations between local and systemic levels of these mediators during orthopedic surgeries in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients who already show increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines due to their disease. We aimed to measure dynamics of blood and drainage fluid levels of IL-6 and IL-8 in postoperative period in rheumatoid arthritis patients undergoing knee replacement surgery and correlate these changes with blood levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), body temperature and pain. We report that blood and drainage fluid levels of IL-6 and IL-8 showed significantly increasing trend during the 36-h period after the surgery. Drainage fluid levels of both cytokines were significantly higher in comparison with blood, indicating their local production in the operated joint. In contrast, levels of CRP were higher in blood than in drainage fluid. Despite the fact that the levels of tested cytokines had already been high in RA patients before surgery, we conclude that after surgery their levels were being much significantly enough high in drainage fluid to reflect dominated local inflammatory reaction to surgical stress and trauma.
18071708	Constitutive expression of a meiotic recombination protein gene homolog, OsTOP6A1, from rice confers abiotic stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants.	Plant productivity is greatly influenced by various environmental stresses, such as high salinity and drought. Earlier, we reported the isolation of topoisomerase 6 homologs from rice and showed that over expression of OsTOP6A3 and OsTOP6B confers abiotic stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. In this study, we have assessed the function of nuclear-localized topoisomerase 6 subunit A homolog, OsTOP6A1, in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. The over expression of OsTOP6A1 in transgenic Arabidopsis plants driven by cauliflower mosaic virus-35S promoter resulted in pleiotropic effects on plant growth and development. The transgenic Arabidopsis plants showed reduced sensitivity to stress hormone, abscisic acid (ABA), and tolerance to high salinity and dehydration at the seed germination; seedling and adult stages as reflected by the percentage of germination, fresh weight of seedlings and leaf senescence assay, respectively. Concomitantly, the expression of many stress-responsive genes was enhanced under various stress conditions in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. Moreover, microarray analysis revealed that the expression of a large number of genes involved in various processes of plant growth and development and stress responses was altered in transgenic plants. Although AtSPO11-1, the homolog of OsTOP6A1 in Arabidopsis, has been implicated in meiotic recombination; the present study demonstrates possible additional role of OsTOP6A1 and provides an effective tool for engineering crop plants for tolerance to different environmental stresses.
18071726	Prevention of cerebral palsy during labour: role of foetal lactate.	OBJECTIVES: Intrapartum foetal monitoring goal is to prevent foetal asphyxia and its most severe consequence: cerebral palsy (CP). In this paper we describe the detection methods and the criteria needed to assess asphyxia during labour for preventing CP. Foetal cerebral damage assessment is considered from the medical-legal point of view. CP represents the most frequent pathology of childhood related to pregnancy and childbirth with an incidence of 0.2% in children born alive. It is clinically regarded as the result of a spectrum of diseases due to damage or to faded development of the nervous system which generally appears at the time of the first stage of intra-uterine growth or depends on problems arising at birth. The goal of our analysis is to recall the various moments in which this event can take place and, if possible, the moment and the degree of the event of asphyxia and its effect on foetal conditions, in order to control and treat it. STUDY DESIGN: One hundred and eighty-eight fetuses were evaluated by means of Apgar score, intrapartum cardiotocography, observation of the presence of meconium stained amniotic fluid, and clinical features of distress at birth. Lactate concentrations were measured during labour and at delivery in blood samples obtained from the foetal presenting part (foetal scalp) and from the umbilical cord with the use of a rapid electrochemical technique. RESULTS: Evidence of clinical foetal distress was not related to the severity of asphyxia. An increased lactate level was found in asphyctic infants and a clear correlation between lactic acidosis and foetal distress was documented. Low Apgar scores were observed in infants with moderate or severe asphyxia at delivery. Scalp lactate correlated significantly with umbilical artery lactate (P = 0.49, 0.01), but with neither Apgar score at 1 min (R = -0.21, ns) nor at 5 min (R = -0.11, ns). Lactate concentration was higher in case of instrumental delivery compared to spontaneous delivery (P = 0.0001). No perfect correlation was found between lactate level and neonatal outcome, but there were not a significant number of neonates with immediate complications. The rate of instrumental delivery in the distress group was significantly higher than in that of the healthy fetuses (P < 0.01), so spontaneous labour was less frequently associated with foetal distress than instrumental delivery (P < 0.01). In the distress group, severe variable decelerations were generally recorded in the second stage of labour. The incidence of neonatal Apgar score </=7 in neonates with abnormal baseline foetal heart rate (FHR) was higher than in those with severe variable decelerations, mild variable decelerations, and transient tachycardia (P < 0.05). The duration of the active second stage of labour correlated significantly with the presence of foetal lactate (P < 0.001) at the time of crowning of foetal head, and the presence of lactate in umbilical cord blood at delivery (P < 0.001). Expulsion time >/=45 min, compared with a shorter active second stage, and acidaemia at birth implied larger arterial-venous lactate differences (P < 0.001). The presence of foetal lactate at crowning was also significantly associated with the level of umbilical arterial-venous lactate difference (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of the fetus should start with the assessment of lactates and acid-base balance. The method which revolutionized the techniques of foetal monitoring is undoubtedly represented by cardiotocography. However, likely most of neurological outcomes are not correlated with a perinatal event or with peripartum asphyxia. Approximately 10% of cases of CP would actually be due to perinatal asphyxia, and this percentage approaches approximately to 15% if we consider only newborns at term. This again confirms the weak association of a causal relationship between asphyxia and CP. In addition, available foetal suffering markers are vague and allow to identify only less than half of the effective cases of newborns which will develop CP.
18071728	Prepregnancy body mass index and adverse pregnancy outcomes.	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between prepregnancy BMI, and adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. METHOD: In this retrospective cohort study 916 consecutive singleton gestations were included who gave birth between 1 January 2006 and 31 August 2006 at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Udine, Italy. Statistical analysis was performed using univaried logistic regression and measured by odds ratio. RESULTS: The obese patients had a statistically, significantly increased incidence of Caesarean section (OR = 2.17, p = 0.009). Women with overweight (OR = 2.43, p = 0.002) and obese weight (OR = 4.86, p < 0.0001) were at increased risk for preterm deliveries. The pre-eclampsia and the fetal macrosomia (> or =4,000 g) were increased in obese women (OR = 5.68, p < 0.0001; OR = 2.58, p = 0.033, respectively). CONCLUSION: Maternal prepregnancy obesity is significantly associated with increased risk of Caesarean section, preterm delivery, pre-eclampsia and macrosomia.
18071799	Laparoscopic common bile duct exploration after failed endoscopic stone extraction.	BACKGROUND: Our objective was to present the technical aspects and results of laparoscopic common bile duct (CBD) exploration following failed endoscopic stone extraction. METHOD: From April 1997 to December 2006, 32 patients were referred to us after unsuccessful attempts at endoscopic CBD stone extraction. Transcholedochal laparoscopic CBD exploration was used in all patients. Previous operations, several pathologic entities, and stone impaction were studied as potential predictors of failure of the laparoscopic approach. RESULTS: Previous operations, cholangitis, anatomic abnormalities, and stone impaction were the principal reasons for failure of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Stone extraction under direct laparoscopic choledochotomy was achieved in 20 of 31 patients (64.51%). Biliary stents were inserted in 7 patients (21.8%) and T tubes were placed in 21 patients (65.6%). Five laparoscopic choledochoduodenostomies were performed. There were 11 conversions to open surgery. Morbidity was 12.5%. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic choledochotomy is an efficacious procedure in dealing with unsuccessful endoscopic CBD clearance.
18071806	Minimally invasive esophagectomy for cancer: laparoscopic transhiatal procedure or thoracoscopy in prone position followed by laparoscopy?	BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive esophagectomy is rapidly emerging as a suitable surgical alternative to the open technique. This retrospective comparative study aimed to compare two minimally invasive techniques for esophagectomy: transhiatal laparoscopy with intrathoracic or cervical anastomosis (group A) and right thoracoscopy in prone position followed by laparoscopy and left cervicotomy (group B) performed by the same surgeon (G.B.C.). The operative time, perioperative blood loss, intensive care and total hospital stays, peri- and postoperative morbidity, in-hospital mortality, number of lymph nodes dissected, and survival were the outcome measures. METHODS: Between April 1999 and August 2005, 24 patients (group A) and 15 patients (group B) underwent minimally invasive esophagectomy for cancer in the authors' department. Their median age was 61 years in group A and 61 years in group B. Preoperatively, the endoscopic location of the tumor was in the upper third in 2 cases (1 vs 1), the middle third in 11 cases (7 vs 4), and the lower third in 26 cases (16 vs 10). Two patients in each group received neoadjuvant chemo- and radiotherapy. One patient (group A) and two patients (group B) received only neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and three patients (group A) received only neoadjuvant radiotherapy. RESULTS: The median operative time was 300 min (range, 240-420 min) in group A and 377 min (range, 240-540 min) in group B (nonsignificant difference [NS]). The median perioperative bleeding was 325 ml (range, 100-800 ml) in group A and 700 ml (range, 100-2,400 ml) in group B (NS). The perioperative complications included one splenectomy in each group and one conversion to thoracotomy in group B. The postoperative medical complications totaled three in group A and six in group B. The postoperative surgical complications included one hemoperitoneum, one pneumothorax, five anastomotic leaks, and two recurrent laryngeal nerve paralyses in group A and two tracheal necroses, four anastomotic leaks, one colic fistula, and three recurrent laryngeal nerve paralyses in group B. The median intensive care unit (ICU) stay was 5 days (range, 2-70 days) for group A and 5 days (range, 1-180 days) for group B (NS). The median hospital stay was 12 days (range, 7-98 days) for group A and 14 days (range, 7-480 days) for group B (p = 0.05). The early mortality rate was 0%. All the specimens were free of disease. The median number of mediastinal/periesophageal lymph nodes was 3 (range, 1-10) for group A and 4 (range, 2-13) for group B (NS), and the median number of celiac/perigastric lymph nodes was 11 (range, 2-31) for group A and 10 (range, 3-22) for group B (NS). After a median follow-up period of 42.4 months (range, 2-84 months) for group A and 19.1 months (range, 1.5-34 months) for group B, 12 patients in group A died after a median period of 22 months (range, 2-55 months), and 7 patients in group B died after a median time of 15 months (range, 1.5-23 months). CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective comparative study showed that minimally invasive esophagectomy performed by thoracoscopy in the prone position is comparable with laparoscopic transhiatal esophagectomy in terms of the significant postoperative and survival outcomes.
18071810	Laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer: safe and effective? - A systematic review.	OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical effectiveness of laparoscopic and laparoscopically assisted surgery in comparison with open surgery for the treatment of colorectal cancer. BACKGROUND: Open resection is the standard method for surgical removal of primary colorectal tumours. However, there is significant morbidity associated with this procedure. Laparoscopic resection (LR) is technically more difficult but may overcome problems associated with open resections (OR). METHODS: Systematic review and meta-analysis of short- and long-term data from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing LS with OR. RESULTS: Highly sensitive searches of nine databases identified 19 primary RCTs describing data from over 4,500 participants. Length of hospital stay is shorter, blood loss and pain are less, and return to usual activities is likely to be faster after LR than after OR, but duration of operation is longer. Lymph node retrieval, completeness of resection and quality of life do not appear to differ. No statistically significant differences were observed in rates of anastomotic leakage, abdominal wound breakdown, incisional hernia, wound and urinary tract infections, operative and 30-day mortality, and recurrences, nor in overall and disease-free survival up to three years. CONCLUSIONS: LR is associated with a quicker recovery in terms of return to usual activities and length of hospital stay with no evidence of a difference in complications or long-term outcomes in comparison to OR, up to three years postoperatively.
18071824	Fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analysis of p53 expression in endometrial cancer: prognostic value and relation to ploidy.	BACKGROUND: Endometrial carcinoma is the most common gynecological malignancy. Several molecular biological characteristics have been studied for their potential value in patient management. OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were to compare p53 immunohistochemical expression with P53 gene status determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and to compare these characteristics with ploidy and with classical clinical and histological prognostic factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed stored specimens from 43 patients with endometrial cancer diagnosed in 1999-2004. P53 FISH and immunohistochemistry were performed, together with imaging cytometry to calculate DNA ploidy. RESULTS: Thirteen of the 43 endometrial carcinomas (30.2%) showed P53 loss of heterozygosity (LOH). P53 LOH correlated with the histological type (P = .03) and the histological grade (P = .004). Quantitative immunohistochemical expression of p53 protein correlated with the histological type (P = .0001). With a cutoff of 10% of p53-positive cells, p53 overexpression correlated with the histological type (P = .003) and grade (P = .0008). No relation was found between P53 LOH or immunohistochemical expression and the disease stage, the depth of myometrial invasion, lymph node status, lymphovascular space involvement, recurrence, or death from cancer. Nondiploid carcinomas showed deeper myometrial invasion than diploid carcinomas (P = .01). No relation was observed between ploidy and qualitative or semiquantitative p53 expression or P53 LOH. CONCLUSION: In endometrial cancer, FISH analysis of P53 status adds no significant prognostic information compared with immunohistochemical p53 analysis.
18072743	Use of near-isogenic wheat lines to determine the glutenin composition and functionality requirements for flour tortillas.	In wheat ( Triticum aestivum L), the synthesis of high molecular weight (HMW) glutenins (GS) is controlled by three heterologous genetic loci present on the long arms of group 1 wheat chromosomes. The loci Glu-A1, Glu-B1, and Glu-D1 and their allelic variants play important roles in the functional properties of wheat flour. This study focused on understanding the functionality of these protein subunits on tortilla quality. Near-isogenic wheat lines in which one or more of these loci were absent or deleted were used. Tortillas were prepared from each deletion line and the parent lines. The elimination of certain HMW-GS alleles alter distinct but critical aspects of tortilla quality such as diameter, shelf stability, and overall quality. Two deletion lines possessing HMW-GS 17 + 18 at Glu-B1 and deletions in Glu-A1 and Glu-D1 had significantly larger tortilla diameters, yet tortilla shelf life was compromised or unchanged from the parent lines used to develop the deletion lines or the commercial tortilla flour used as a control. Alternatively, a deletion line possessing Glu-A1 and Glu-D1 (HMW-GS 1, 5 + 10) and a deletion in Glu-B1 also significantly improved tortilla diameters. Whereas the increase in diameter was less than the line possessing only HMW-GS 17 + 18 at Glu-B1, the stability of the tortillas were, however, maintained and improved as compared to the parent lines containing a full compliment of HMW-GS. Thus, the presence of subunits 5 + 10 at Glu-D1 alone or in combination with subunit 1 at Glu-A1 appears to provide a compromise of improvement in dough extensibility for improved tortilla diameters while also providing sufficient gluten strength to maintain ideal shelf stability.
18072747	Synthesis and evaluation of novel biodegradable hydrogels based on poly(ethylene glycol) and sebacic acid as tissue engineering scaffolds.	Novel biodegradable poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) based hydrogels, namely, PEG sebacate diacrylate (PEGSDA) were synthesized, and their properties were evaluated. Chemical structures of these polymers were confirmed by Fourier transform infrared and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy. After photopolymerization, the dynamic shear modulus of the hydrogels was up to 0.2 MPa for 50% PEGSDA hydrogel, significantly higher than conventional hydrogels such as PEG diacrylate (PEGDA). The swelling ratios of these macromers were significantly lower than PEGDA. The in vitro degradation study demonstrated that these hydrogels were biodegradable with weight losses about 66% and 32% for 25% and 50% PEGSDA after 8 weeks of incubation in phosphate-buffered saline at 37 degrees C. In vitro biocompatibility was assessed using cultured rat bone marrow stromal cells (MSCs) in the presence of unreacted monomers or degradation products. Unlike conventional PEGDA hydrogels, PEGSDA hydrogel without RGD peptide modification induced MSC cell adhesion similar to tissue culture polystyrene. Finally, complex three-dimensional structures of PEGSDA hydrogels using solid free form technique were fabricated and their structure integrity was better maintained than PEGDA hydrogels. These hydrogels may find use as scaffolds for tissue engineering applications.
18072767	Specific RNA self-assembly with minimal paranemic motifs.	The paranemic crossover (PX) is a motif for assembling two nucleic acid molecules using Watson-Crick (WC) basepairing without unfolding preformed secondary structure in the individual molecules. Once formed, the paranemic assembly motif comprises adjacent parallel double helices that crossover at every possible point over the length of the motif. The interaction is reversible as it does not require denaturation of basepairs internal to each interacting molecular unit. Paranemic assembly has been demonstrated for DNA but not for RNA and only for motifs with four or more crossover points and lengths of five or more helical half-turns. Here we report the design of RNA molecules that paranemically assemble with the minimum number of two crossovers spanning the major groove to form paranemic motifs with a length of three half turns (3HT). Dissociation constants (Kd's) were measured for a series of molecules in which the number of basepairs between the crossover points was varied from five to eight basepairs. The paranemic 3HT complex with six basepairs (3HT_6M) was found to be the most stable with Kd = 1 x 10-8 M. The half-time for kinetic exchange of the 3HT_6M complex was determined to be approximately 100 min, from which we calculated association and dissociation rate constants ka = 5.11 x 103 M-1s-1 and kd = 5.11 x 10-5 s-1. RNA paranemic assembly of 3HT and 5HT complexes is blocked by single-base substitutions that disrupt individual intermolecular Watson-Crick basepairs and is restored by compensatory substitutions that restore those basepairs. The 3HT motif appears suitable for specific, programmable, and reversible tecto-RNA self-assembly for constructing artificial RNA molecular machines.
18072780	Stepwise self-assembly of DNA tile lattices using dsDNA bridges.	The simple helical motif of double-strand DNA (dsDNA) has typically been judged to be uninteresting for assembly in DNA-based nanotechnology applications. In this letter, we demonstrate construction of superstructures consisting of heterogeneous DNA motifs using dsDNA in conjunction with more complex, cross-tile building blocks. Incorporation of dsDNA bridges in stepwise assembly processes can be used for controlling length and directionality of superstructures and is analogous to the "reprogramming" of sticky-ends displayed on the DNA tiles. Two distinct self-assembled DNA lattices, fixed-size nanoarrays, and extended 2D crystals of nanotracks with nanobridges, are constructed and visualized by high-resolution, liquid-phase atomic force microscopy.
18072860	Quantification and characterization of autotransduction in retroviral vector producer cells.	Gene therapy has evolved into a tempting strategy for the management of cancer and other life-threatening diseases. Various approaches employ retroviral vectors to deliver the therapeutic gene. The profound knowledge about retrovirus biology allows the generation of increasingly advanced vector systems as well as an accurate assessment and management of potential safety risks. This study focuses on the genetic stability of retrovirus producer cells as a basic safety requirement and its compromise by autotransduction. It has been shown previously that protection of retroviral packaging systems by superinfection interference is not guaranteed. The current study provides insight into the extent of autotransduction and the time point at which it occurs, and examines strategies to antagonize it. Therefore, a reconstituting vector system was used that obviates transgene expression in virus producer cells by physically separating transgene and promoter. Just on infection two functional expression cassettes are reconstituted, causing highly efficient transgene expression in transduced cells. Equipped with an enhanced green fluorescent protein-encoding gene, this vector allowed accurate quantification of autotransduced cells, which were then isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and further characterized. Sequencing of recloned integrated vector copies demonstrated that high transgene expression levels were strictly associated with the presence of reverse-transcribed vector copies. Envelope protein expression levels, however, were found to be equal in autotransduced and noninfected virus producer cells. Finally, the occurrence of autotransduction could be assigned to an early time point after transfection and was successfully blocked by azidothymidine treatment, yielding a stable and homogeneous population of noninfected retrovirus producer cells.
18073189	Remediation of the protein data bank archive.	The Worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB; wwpdb.org) is the international collaboration that manages the deposition, processing and distribution of the PDB archive. The online PDB archive at ftp://ftp.wwpdb.org is the repository for the coordinates and related information for more than 47 000 structures, including proteins, nucleic acids and large macromolecular complexes that have been determined using X-ray crystallography, NMR and electron microscopy techniques. The members of the wwPDB-RCSB PDB (USA), MSD-EBI (Europe), PDBj (Japan) and BMRB (USA)-have remediated this archive to address inconsistencies that have been introduced over the years. The scope and methods used in this project are presented.
18073210	Differential coupling of M1 muscarinic and alpha7 nicotinic receptors to inhibition of pemphigus acantholysis.	The mechanisms mediating and regulating assembly and disassembly of intercellular junctions is a subject of intensive research. The IgG autoantibodies produced in patients with the immunoblistering skin disease pemphigus vulgaris (PV) can induce keratinocyte (KC) dyshesion (acantholysis) via mechanisms that involve signaling kinases targeting intercellular adhesion molecules, thus providing a useful model to study the physiologic regulation of KC cohesion. Previous studies showed that activation of Src and protein kinase C are the earliest events in the PV IgG-induced intracellular phosphorylation cascades and that cholinergic agonists are effective for treating patients with pemphigus. In this study, we sought to elucidate the molecular mechanisms allowing cholinergic agonists to inhibit PV IgG-induced acantholysis and phosphorylation of KC adhesion molecules. The extent of acantholysis in KC monolayers correlated closely with the degree of PV IgG-induced phosphorylation of p120- and beta-catenins, with classic isoforms of protein kinase C mediating serine phosphorylation of beta-catenin and Src-tyrosine phosphorylation of p120-catenin. The M(1) muscarinic agonist pilocarpine blocked phosphorylation of both catenins, which could be abolised by the M(1) antagonist MT7. The alpha7 nicotinic agonist AR-R17779 inhibited phosphorylation of P120-cateinin. The alpha7 antagonist methyllycaconitine abolished the effect of AR-R17779. Okadaic acid abrogated protective effects of agonists on phosphorylation of beta-catenin, and pervanadate, on that of p120-catenin. Stimulation of KCs with pilocarpine significantly (p < 0.05) elevated both serine/threonine and tyrosine phosphatase activities in KCs. AR-R17779 both stimulated tyrosine phosphatase and decreased PV IgG-induced Src activity. Methyllycaconitine released Src activity in intact KCs and caused acantholysis. Thus, downstream signaling from M(1) abolished PV IgG-dependent catenin phosphorylation due to activation of both serine/threonine and tyrosine phosphatases, whereas alpha7 action involved both activation of tyrosine phosphatase and inhibition of Src. These findings identified novel paradigm of regulation of signaling kinases associated with cholinergic receptors and provided mechanistic explanation of therapeutic activity of cholinomimetics in PV patients.
18073308	Granulosa cell survival and proliferation are altered in polycystic ovary syndrome.	CONTEXT: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) represents the most common endocrine abnormality in women of reproductive age. The cause of PCOS remains largely unknown, but studies suggest an intrinsic ovarian abnormality. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to test our hypothesis that differences in granulosa cell proliferation and apoptosis may underlie abnormalities that affect follicular development. DESIGN: Granulosa cells were prepared from follicular fluid aspirated from 4- to 8-mm follicles of unstimulated ovaries during routine laparoscopy or laparotomy from women with anovulatory PCOS and those with regular ovulatory cycles. SETTING: The study was conducted at a university hospital. PATIENTS: Fourteen women with anovulatory PCOS and nine women with regular ovulatory cycles participated in the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Immunocytochemistry on granulosa cells to investigate apoptotic and proliferation rates, together with real-time RT-PCR to analyze gene expression profiles of apoptotic regulators, was measured. RESULTS: Significantly lower apoptotic rates were found in granulosa cells from patients with PCOS, compared with women with regular ovulatory cycles (P=0.004). Lower apoptotic rates were associated with decreased levels of the apoptotic effector caspase-3 (P=0.001) and increased levels of the anti-apoptotic survival factor cellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins-2 in the PCOS group that were coupled to higher proliferation rates (P=0.032). Gene expression profiling confirmed the immunocytochemical findings. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that there are significant differences in the rate of cell death and proliferation in granulosa cell populations in PCOS patients. These are associated with decreased expression of apoptotic effectors and increased expression of a cell survival factor. These results provide new insights that may be useful in developing specific therapeutic intervention strategies in PCOS.
